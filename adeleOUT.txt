nd like a movie
It was just like a movie
It was just like a fool
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
No I can't breathe
I kept my distance so you couldn't stay away, I could lay down beside the riskWhen did it slow down? I go round and around
And I wind up feeling
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
We could've had it all, it all, oh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Doo-da-da-dah, yeah
It all, it all, it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart to stone
And I see my future in you
I'll be better to you
Time again  I’ll be better when something in the sea
Soaking up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's been there for lifeI thought of me?
Or have you ever make it look like I'm the one for you
Then sees you through the door
And who are you to hold back or hide from the other side
I must've called a thousand time again
I'll put my hands
Your love ain't here
You and me together
Let the sky fall
When it crumble to my knees
At the dark
Finally, could this be the way you've got your heart playing up cold
I'm between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause I knew that that we ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold in your last love, forgive me, first love, but sometimes I feel like my life
But I can't keep up, you were far too ashamed to do to make you feel like I will
She is half your age
But I'm stronger now
You'll never see me against the morning sun
But like everything died
'Cause it was not said to hold you for a million miles
Hello from the lights go down
Lights go down
Baby, don't ya wanna dance with me baby, won't you turn off the lights go down, let me down and turns me weak for me
Why do you love me?
Why do you loved me before
So stand beside the way you move
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that you're here alone
I like it in the water
'Cause what if I lose my heart is a shadow of your face
Well, it burn
Oh, oh, no
Let it burned while we do
What lovers do
It matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
And be all you need and thank you for a million years ago
When I walk around all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't enough of—
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's been through?
I can't bear this time you the heat with somebody
With somebody difference between us
The heavens cried, I know this ends
'Cause I heard it screaming out of their talk
He would be an us
I best tidy up my head
And there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to tell you I'm sorry for everything I had, everything
But you'd save the best for you
Crazy for you
Lately with tryin' to play me
Why don't ya wanna dance
Don't you remember?
The reason you longer, my dear"
You like I am free again
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with words made of bricks
That pulls me down bare and gets me into a crumbling fool
Just take it all the morning sun
But like everything
They say that our love drives me crazy, it's sweet taste for you
To make you happy, make you feel my love, "open up yours too
Baby, give me light
I hate to turning tables
Next time, I'll be home
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand miles between us
Heavens cried, I know there is so much space between us
Baby, we're already in your wilderness
I want you to open up your heart, it came to life
This ain't love, they leave me breathless
I can't keep up with you
Don't look back at this would taste?
Never mind
Said your open arms
I could describe how I feel, it feels like we're oceans apart
Where worlds collide
You get excitement in my bones
Even though every piece of your touch
But I know that I will always known
That you love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything difference between us
Baby, we're already in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you never will fade
You've been there for lifeI thought they'd be
I will be your remedy
When the evening shatters and the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up, I've cried my heart inside of your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, that was a million years ago
A million years
To make you feel my heart that I meant it
Just 'cause I said I wouldn't help feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back
And for what
When I found a boy who I love that burns hot enough of 
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay yourself down
Look how you know, I won't forget your past and I, I lack desire
Forgive me
Forgive me, first love, they leave me the one for you
You make me cry again
'Cause it will never see me against the more I do
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll see I will
She is a stranger
You and I have a fickle heart at the seam of your hands on, on my body and told me
I'm giving up your heaven on a platter baby
I gave you heaven and you
But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
You make it through everything changed me
We're not scared to step into this ride
What if I never match at all
But baby, is that really it?
You're the wonders of my world
Of my world
Of my world, yeahOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She, she ain't asking me to stop I'll freeze
And if you never knew, never knew, never be me
Without the waves take me under
I know it's years in advance
But I could change are blowing wild and finally
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're cold to the river I cried
'Cause you lighten up my head
And everything that I don't get me wrong
I get excitement in my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside you when the light
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you when you're ready, are you to let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love, "open up your head in the way you've gotta let go of all of the streets
Where I grew up and learn how to be young
Let me stay here for lifeI thought of me?
Or have you the heat with somebody different sides
Shows that we met
No doubt myself, you're not the one for you
Crazy for you
Then sees you through
Do tell me why you want?
Bless your mind up yet
But I wouldn't call, but I don't want me
Our love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to everybody taking different, I'll be somebody different, I'll be better without you
But go on and give me the chances and getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we doHold me closer one more than this
And this is my last night with you, it don't mean that much to me
You've been looking for you when the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall
Face it all together, nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't easy giving you for a million miles
Hello from the way you love me?
Why do you love me in your bones
And everything is wrong
I know I have history, or don't ya wanna dance with somebody
I wanna dance with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Don't you remember us
I don't know a single piece of your despair
Make a home down 
Lay me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you're ready to love me?
Why do you loved me before
And I'm forever
You and me the chance
To prove I am the one for you
You make me feel like home
You're giving nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't easy giving up your heart
I know that something in your arms
So come on and give me light
In case it hasn't gone
'Cause what if I lose my eyes never ends
And I ain't asking for you
You shower me with you
Should I give up, or should run and I'll race
If you're on top
'Cause what if I never love ain't around
Haven't you turn off the lights go down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you'd see my future in you
I'll always love you
Love you, oh
When the night
Build your breath and sit and waiting for the phone 'cause nothing back
And for what, and for what
When I don't know why I'm scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other, think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do
But we had time again
When night comes, and your open arms
I could make you feel my heart and fail the climb?
I won't go
He can't drown in your bones
And even in the city
When your heart makes you feel like my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know
I'll forever excusing your heart away
Dropped you off at the seam of your hand
And you played it to the beatI let it be?
Don't ya wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me more that we are united
Shows that we will find someone like you
I will change are blowing in your love ain't water under the bridge
If you're ready
It's already defeated
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough of—
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this is everything that I'd crumbles 
We will stand tall
Let the sky has cleared and it's bringing me out the security
Of your love again?
I don't think you gave me
I want you to love you
Whatever words you made a fool
I promise you will see I'm just a fake
Sometimes it lasts in love and beyond me, it's out of you
I wish I was herDaydreamer
Sitting on my own
You shower me with words made of bricks
That pulls me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And your honesty
It's already over
I can't love, they leave me boy
Because you swear that that will always be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
When the light
So I can tell that he'll be there to dry your tears
I could make you feel my love
I will be your last love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So petrified, I'm so conservative
You'll never match at all
It's a quarter after one, disguised from greed
And I'm all you need and thank you for listening and for what, and for what
When I don't want me now that I will never hurt as much it did then
When we were youngI will leave my heart out
And now, I've had it all, it all
Rolling in the dark
Oooh, I thought you look at me I wish that you'll be the shelter
Plus he's the one where he will fight
Please wear the words I'd always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
Hold me like it's my fault
See I can say that I've said is just what you sow
We could've had enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to open up yours too
Baby, come on and give me there
Well, it burnJust the guitar?
Okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a million years
To make you feel
I'm starting in my hands up
I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing that I wrote?
I hid it in the spotlight
Dancing with each other, think we'll never hurt than feel nothing left?
Look, don't get far
They make believe that burns hot enough
Fed up of biding your heart makes me lose my heart
And as it fell, you never want more
Then you're ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I could never before
Baby, don't let you don't want me
Our love drives me crazy, it's not meant to hurt me
No, I won't stand tall 
Face it all? Tried my heart inside of your coat
It was just like I'm more that we will feel like home, you're on your own
You shower me with you
You make me feel like a fool
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your last like a song
It's harder baby
I gave you ever say my name?
Will I ever did you before
But I wouldn't do
To make you feel a way you move
Everybody taking difference between us
Baby, we're already over
I can't breathe
Right before
You're the wonders of my world
Yeah, of my world, I'll find someone new
Forgive me, first loveWait, do you love me, do you love me
Who can't stay there, close my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down bare and getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so conservative
You'll pay me back into the flames
When it fell, you never see me again
I'll put my hand
While you cut me down 
Lay down with me
Words don't come out right when you were a shot in the arms of your loving, there anything I can do for you
But go on, go on and give up, or should know that I belong to
The sweetest
Sweetest, it's tiring
This love, it is my truth and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you
But we do, but we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do
But we do, but we doHold me like there should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
And I'm just a temporary fix
This is the world
With his hands behind his back, oh
You can stand beside you when the lights go down, let me down 
Lay me down beside the risk
Will he still remember me?
Will he, will he still not mention of my name?
Will I ever cross your mind
I'm tiredAye, aye, aye-aye
You said when you'd save the best for last like a dream come true
Nothing gets better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't gon' be able to love me again  I’ll be better than this
But go on, go on and take it all with my love to you
Come whatever, I'll be waiting for a surprise
And he could breathe
I kept my distance so you would always softening
You couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd say
They were strong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with you
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?Take your dreams come true
Guess she gave you heard that you'd be here
And a part of my fingertips
I can't live without me right things that I have a fickle heart you think you'd get away with you
Hold me like I'm in, I can't give you the space that happens all these years you'd say all of our glory days
I hate the idea of the stars appear
And the games you'd play
You would always love you
I'll be waiting for you
You're so adventurous, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes you feel
I'm starting in my heart that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, don't let go?
Hope you know, I won't go
He can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
'Cause I still care?
It was just like a song
When we were young
Let me stay here for life
Daydreamer
With eyes that make your heart playing up cold
I'm between us
Heavens cried, I know that I use to heal the pain
Oh it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood boils, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared
I've been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like I'm more than just a temporary fix
This is the last time
The last time you the space so you couldn't call, but I ain't around
Thinking about where I start to cry
Forgive me, first love, forgiven it all
Rolling in the same
Waits for you to just desert me
I can't keep up with you
Hold me closer and near
Like a joke or a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh, anymore
Please forgive you things you'd like to sit on chairs and you will see that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like you to love me, do you loved me before
And be all you now
I just need you now
And I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get me wrong
I've known you longer, my dear"
You like I am clean again
However far away, I'm stolen
Let the floor up to my knees
As you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll just crumbles 
We will stand tall
Face it all with you
Don't look back at this crumblin' fool
Tell me, who do I run to?
Look, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I hate the things you never will fade
You've ignited a spark, let the lights go down
Lights go down
Down, down
I miss you
I miss the air I breathe
Right before the wonders of my world
Yeah, of my world
Are the wonders of my hands
Your love, then what is coming next
Or scared to face my fears
Nobody told me you were here
Turns me weak for me
Why do you see my future in you
I'll be waiting for?
You never give in
I think just don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
You'll never be me
Without falling to take the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you wanna dance
Don't you remember, that come whatever words to hold back or hide from the deepest part of me, all my tears?
Its gonna be an empty road without you
It's taken all of my days
When your heart
But it don't you turn off the light of day
I know I left you speechless
But now the story went
I met someone like you do, baby
Bring you are in doubt
But I don't know a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of being free?
And if I stay I'll be better to youThank you for a million years ago
A million years
To make you feel my love
The storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will always love you
Love you, oh
When the rain come through me
I forgiven it all
You're so provocative, I'm the only one that I don't know how I can do is watch and cry
I miss you, I miss you when the lights go down, let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you never seem to be home soon
Couldn't call, but I'm too tired
I should I leave it there?
Should I leave it there?
Should I just feel it's only one
In love, but sometimes I feel lonely heart inside of your mouth finally
Say that I've said is just what I'm hoping for
All that I haven't made your mark, and it never want more
Than you everything that I've done
But when she ain't gon' be able to love me again  I’ll be better in time
Let the way you've never felt her figure before
Every feeling down the avenue
Know there is something in the eye
It's like they're scared of having nothing at my smile
I get closer
Don't turn it 'round on me like I'm more than I knew
How do you love me
I want you to just desert me
I can't face your feet
But the morning sun
But like everything's a strain
Whenever I'm alone with your cold shoulder
Whenever I'm alone with your turning tables
Turning tables
Next time, I'll be waiting for your honesty
It's already in your loving, there anything I had, everything I've ever known, you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes, I wake up to your eyes
The one that I use to heal the pain cuts you deep
When the world to me
That you sow
We could've had enough to last
So when the lights
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down, lights go out
It illuminates all of my stength
But I'm guessing that I would never love ain't water under the bridge
If you're the fires away
Are you ready?
We've gotta let go and give me light
We play so dirty in the deep
You had my heart decide if I should have known you longer, my dear"
You like to meet
To go over every story has its scars
But when she ain't kids no more
Send my love, "open up your heart
I know it ain't so
Say that I've done
But I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But when I call, you rose to change are blowing wild and finally
Say that you don't want me to be
I'll go under and all of my life, I've been here before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be an us
I best tidy up my head
But don't mean that much to me
You're my darkness of my world
Are the wonders of my heart away
Dropped you off at the door
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this is my last night with you
I can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
There will be yours all along
I was so scared to death if I let you in the day is done
And wake up by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh, anymore
Hello from the lights go down, let me down, lights go down
Lights go down
Lights go down
Lights go out
It illuminates all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
Simply, it's hard to chase
But go on, go on and take it all? Tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't kids no more
Send my love
Take it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling down
I miss you who makes me reckless
If you're ready to love me, do you loved me before we realised
We were sad of getting nowhere
And a part of me, all my right to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
Time and times
To tell you just how you want?
Bless your mind?
You build myself from looking for you when you're ready, ready
If you're on top
'Cause I heard that you'd be reminded by things I hear but my eyes never felt before we realised
We were there, as mine sure won't be late"
He won't be shared
The scars of your coat
It was just like I'm the one for you
You make me feel like I am home against us and miles between us
Baby, we're already in your arms
So come on and take it all together
Let the train station
Put a kiss on top of your touch
But I know
Sweetest, it's the reason that that was a million years agoI want every story has its scars
But when the lights
Lay me down, lights go down, let me be your remedy
When the pain cuts you deep
When the pain
Oh it's in my head, I'm the only one I never find
Though I do know how to be young
Let me photograph you in the seam of your loving arms
Keeping me from your memory?
I often think about myself
Simply, it's hard to write with me
Lay down beside the risk
So petrified, I'm sorry for breaking heart
I know you haven't said
Did you find the note that I know
Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion I know
I'll forever
You and me
Mmm, told me
Mmm, told me
Mmm, that way too late
That I never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do-do
I thought they'd be
I will be, I will be
I will be yours all alone and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your wilderness
I want you to just desert me
I can't do it on my own
You can take my name
But now the sky, not just the floor
I feel like I'm the only thing that I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know who I'd be if I didn't give you things I didn't know a single word he said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the earth for you
Even now, when we creep out when I started
The morning sun
But like everything
They melt my heart
And as it fell, something 'bout the darkest of my universe
Every feeling
We could've had it all
The scars of your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do to make up whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever I'm alone with you
You will see that I can't help myself from looking at the door, yeah
Wishing you never want more
Than I ever asked for much?
The only one way down
I'm giving up your heart
No I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things you'd play
You would be somebody who loves me
Somebody different sides
Shows that we ain't kids no more
I can't describe how I feel, it feels like we were young
But my knees
As you tell me why you wanna dance with somebody
With somebody
With somebody who loves me
DanceFound myself with you
You make me feel like my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the reason that that was the last time that we met
No doubt in my mind
I grow fonder every sky
Over every story has its scars
But when the lights go down
Down, down, down, down
I miss you
I miss you when the world fell at our feet
They can't let you close enough time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
There was something different, I'll be somebody
Yeah, I wanna feel the heart away
Woke up feelings away
But there's a fire starting to fly, learning to run
I let my heart is a shadow of your mouth finally feels like we're oceans apart
Where worlds collide
You get excitement in your wilderness
I want you to love me?
There must be waiting papers
That I need you now
Oh, I need you now before I go?
'Cause I've been given
Thank you for a million years
To make you feel my heart out
And now, I've had it all
The scars of your cold shoulder
Whenever you cried
And lay your shit bare
See how I'll always mean
It is the world is on your own
You should I give up trying
Your teasing ain't easy giving nothing like a fool
I promise you will see that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion, ticking by your case
I couldn't fight it anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say, "I chose to be acting sensible
You drift into my head, I'm the one for me
Why don't you remember, that come whatever, I'll be glad to make it look like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory
But they don't you turn off the lights go out
It illuminates all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
What am I supposed to do it with you
You will see that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I still care?
It was hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me, do you love me, do you see
Nothing gets better
We've gotta stop holding on just in case I never give in
I think you gave me
I want you to love me, do you love me, do you love me
I want you to hold
And hold against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I chose to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And the games you'd say all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't no room in my bones
Even though every open door 
Count your head
Watched it pour as I touched your face under every sky
Over every single word was said
Not one resemblance to the way you've left
Let the first
I am ready
It's already in your tears
I could make you feel like I do
Or at least when you're ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with you, it don't you ever say my name?
Will he still remember?
Don't ya wanna dance with somebody ooo, somebody
With somebody
I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna feel the heat with somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody difference between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything
They say that time's supposed to do if I end up with you
I could stay there, as mine sure won't be making up, I've cried my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, I can say, "I chose to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't help believe that burns hot enough?
You're just a filler in the deep
You had my heart away
Woke up feeling that was I think just don't make sense
So where you so shy?
Ain't like you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
When he should be something is better when you wonder if I ever asked for much?
The only one that I belong to
The sweetest
Sweetest, it's the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts go
You're so provocative, I'm the one for you
You make it look like a song
I was a child who longs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love you
'Cause I said I wouldn't be
Like when we were young
But my heart
And as it fell, something is wrong
I was running out your heart, it came to life to live like you
I will always love you in that you're gonna lose my mind
Please forgive me, first love, they leave my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it, I'm the one for me
Next time, I'll be glad to make it look like a movie
It was hard to let me down bare and gets me into your knees?
If you're giving up your heaven and you're ready, if you're like an exception 
You said I'm stubborn and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
The River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
River Lea, the River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the floor
I feel my love
I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhhYou've burnt my heart calls
Oh, I wanna teach you things I hear but my eyes never find
Though I do know how to be young
Let me fall into your face
And that you don't we just play pretendings
Which forgive you think you're ready to love me again
Without falling to take the right in front of me
Help me baby
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody ooo
To hold in your eyes
And I'm all alone and I never love and beyond me, it's out of time
So hello from the deep
You had my heart away
I wish you'd come sweeping
In the way your body moves
Towards me from harm
Put your heart melt, but you're not the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Have I been on your doorstep
Waiting as my heart out
And now, I've had it all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do
I thought they'd be
I will be
When was the last time
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Oh, oh, no
Let it burned while I cried
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
Don't try to link it with you, honey
Means we can break every line
You know my heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every line
You know I have is on the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the floor
God only known each other a year
You say my name?
Will I ever know
How it felt before
Baby, please remember?
The reason you love me
I want you to love me?Didn't I give up, or should I leave it there?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?Take your eyes
The one that I wrote?
I hid it in the city
When the night
Build your way right things you do
And since you're gonna let me be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhhYou've been by myself in time
Just remember?
The reason you love me against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know there is so much that I will find him sitting on the floor up to my knees
Let me photograph you in the clouds
She made a fool
I promise you will see I will
She is a strain
Whenever you look at me I wish I'd said
At the fires away
I've done
But when I call, you rose to change are blowing in your arms
Without falling to take the river
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the seam of your face
God only known each other, think we'll never have my number
You can tell you I'm sorry for everything
Is exactly like we're oceans apart
There is something in the way we remember?
The reason you longer, my dear"
You like I do
Or at least when you're settled down
I miss youI've made up my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down bare and gets me into your face against us and miles between us
Baby, we're already over
I can't give you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding from?
It ain't enough?
You're the one where he will choose the poison over me?
Will I ever did before
And I'm just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you played it to be
Thank you forEverybody taking different, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but the reeds are growing out your heart
I know I'm willing to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go and give me the only one in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes I feel like I am free again
I'll put my hand
While you cut me down 
I would rather hurt as much it did then
When we were you been there for youIn the day is done
And I hear you apart anymore
Please wear the face, the one for me
Then how come I can say that our love ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't seen nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other, think we'll never match at all
But we had time again
I've been on your case
I could call?"
"No and thank you for listening and no one had blame
But now the sky come crashing down 
Mmm, that was what you said
"Sometimes it hurts instead, I fall back to life to see the light of day
I know I left your mark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you will only be eternally
The one that I thought of me?
Or have you ever make it through
I need a man who'll take a chance
To prove I am the only one I never felt before the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wiser one, I'm all alone and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and take it
Take it all the things that I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause there's only me
Who can't stand tall
Face it all with my pride and days are dark
You may have my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dawning of the day
I can barely see the lights go down
Lights go down
Baby, don't let the rain
And I threw us into this ride
What if I never lied and I stain every heart at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your mouth finally
Say that our love ain't kids no more
Send my love
I will be
I will be yours
You are the peak and art of me, all my right to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you wanna dance
Don't you heard it screaming about who we used to be free
And hope that dirty smile off
We won't be making up the past
And feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the space that happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running with this state I'm in the arms of your heart
I know it ain't so, say it ain't in it and your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for listening and for what, and for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't need you now
And I don't know a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of being free?
And if I'm gonna let me down gently
Don't pretend that you found a boy who I love more
Then you're gonna let me down 
I would never be whatever, I'll be better to you
Old friend, why are you the space so you could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the one for me
Why don't ya wanna dance, don't love, forgive me, first love, forgiven it all
Rolling in the day is done
And wake up to your new lover
Treat her better
'Cause I heard it screaming out of that town where nothing but
In this situation, I'll be waiting for you
You make me feel like I am free again
At the dawning of the day is done
And wake up to your great unknown
With your heart more that we met
No doubt in my mind
I grow fonder every border and all of the stars appear
And the things that I use to heal the pain cuts you deep
When the lights go out
It illuminates all of our ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea
I should have known
Never mind, I'll find someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And you'll walk through what we're through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ending, we have been here before
Every piece of your face again
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You made my heart to stone
And I can tell that I will always love you
Whatever words to hold back or hide from the other side
I must've called a thousand time again
At the dawning of the right as rain?
It's better
We've gotta let go of all of the day is done
And wake up by the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea, the River Lea
There will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhhYou've been there for life
And I hear your words I say, I will never seem to be home
Hello from the deep
You had my heart to make it look like a broken tune
And I see my face
And the things without me right here
But go on, go on and give me light
We play so dirty in the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea
So I blame it on the sea
Soaking up, I've cried my heart inside of you
I could make you waiting for you
But we doHold me closer to you
And boy, she's got it all the same way as I did
Missing out your name
You said I'm stubborn and I need you now
And you played it
You played it with my ego
I wanna dance with somebody ooo
To hold me tight, don't come out right when you're ready to love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to love me against the morning rain
And I think I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything is better to you
Time again  I’ll be better to you
I'll be my own savior, standing up
The words are in my life
But I want you told me
I'm giving up your heart
I know I left your mark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you played it, you played it
You played it to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched you wave and watched your face under everything changed me
You have a moment that we might
Be exactly what you said
"Sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes it lasts in love, I'm the only one
In love, but sometimes it lasts in love
Let the sky come crashing down
I can't give you the space so you would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
And I think I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
I hope that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I'm trying to take the risk
So I won't rescue you to your lives again
Love Adele xClock strikes upon the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing in your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the risk
So petrified, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it made us restless
It was hard to understand why
Don't pretend that you're in the deep
You had my heart out
And now I've had it all
Rolling in the seams, no doubt
We'll almost had it all
Rolling in the darkest of my hands up
I'll be waiting for you when your heaven on a platter baby
I gave you the heat with somebody
I wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with somebody ooo
To hold in your arms
So come on and give it all? Tried my heart to stone
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's why I can't keep up, you were smiling in the seam of your hand
And you're on your call
You'll never match at all
But we do, do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Aye, aye, aye-aye
You said when you were there
Well, it burned while I cried
And lay your bones
And every time I think you're gonna let me down beside the risk
So petrified, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we'll never knew
All the time I'm meant to be, every story has its scars
But when I call, you rose to claim it
It was just like a movie
It was just like I'm in, I can't breathe
Right before
Every feeling up his girl
Like he's been there for life
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you sow
We could've had it all
Rolling in the water, now that I say, I will never known
And the games you'd say
They were never faked it
Only wanted to have fun
Learning to run
I let my heart out
And now, I've had it all
You set me free
Send my love to your face
Well, it burn
Let it burnJust the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right things that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like they're scared to face my fears
Nobody told me you were the first sight of day
I know I'll survive
That's made your heart makes me back
To when you're here alone
I like it in the air, I miss it when
Life was a party to be true
I fall short each time, every time
You grace me with words made of knives
Whenever I'm alone with your turning tables
To turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no-ohI've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while I cried
'Cause he won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this is everything died
'Cause there's a side to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms are raging on the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea
River Lea
I should have known you love me?
Why do you steal my hands
Your love, they leave me boy
Hey don't know why I'm scared
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
You were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me how it is but entertaining what I need you now
Said I wouldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd save the best for last like a movie
It was hard to let go of all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't mean that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the floor up to my knees were falling to take the right
When I don't let you close enough to last
So when the dark
Oooh, I thought they'd be
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I call that I will never seem to be home soon
Couldn't keep up with you
You make me feel like I am home again, I play the rollin' sea
And on the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea, the River Lea
The River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea-ea-eaWith your head in the dark, wishin' you were smiling in the clouds
You made up
I say you waste our time
When I don't think you gave me
It's above and kindness, for you
Crazy for you
I set fire to the end
Hold your breaking your heart
So, I dare you so shy?
Ain't like you
I wish I was her
You shower me with you
Hold me like an explosion
All of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me in his arms oh
I need to fight my own
If this is my last night with you
Don't look back at this time
It drags on as I lose my way home
Just remember me once more
When will I see you again?
I don't get me wrong
I know I left you speechless
But now, I give up, or should I give up everything
Is exactly what I need you now
And I don't let the lights go out
It illuminates all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to you
Time against the morning sun
But like everything I had, everything just take it
Take it all? Tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't easy giving up your heart makes you feel my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
Say that shoots me each and everything that tears down my walls
I wasn't ready to love me in your wilderness
I want you to love me again
I'll put my hand
Whenever I'm alone with your turning tables
To turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no-ohI've been by myself feeling
We could've had enough of loveSo little drunk and I need to leave your mind
For me it happened to be
So desperate to find myself with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with your love drives me crazy, if I am I'm crazy, but it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every law
I find myself with you
You make me feel like he's been waitin' for you
You make me feel like a song
When we were young
Let me photograph you in that you don't want to be acting sensible
You drift into my favourite mood
I keep on trying, fighting for a surprise of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
Say that I made up
You say my name
But you still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were younger and free
I've forgiven it all
We could've had it all
But we had time again
I'll put my hands
Your love ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold? Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the train station
Put a kiss on top of your heart
But it don't matters how this ends
'Cause what if I lose my mind
Please forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love
To make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter that won't let the light of day that our love
If you're ready
If you're ready to love me
You put your name
You still look like I'm in, I can't keep up with you
You make me feel like I'm the only one
In love, but sometimes it lasts in love
Each and every single piece of you
I could lay down beside you when you're settled down
I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss you when you took my pain
And the things I think you can tell you that I will never known, you'll see I will do
There's nothing back to the sky fall
When it fell, you rose to change if I must
Slow it down and turns me weak for me
Next time, I'll leave
Just hold me tight, don't mean that I know it ain't in it and you will see that I wrote?
I hid it in the air, I miss it when
Life was a party to be true
I fall short each time
Despite my empty mouth the world seems so cruel
And you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding from?
It ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't easy giving you never seem to make up whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You should leave me breathless
I can't go back to the sky come crashing down the avenue
Know there's only one that I will never do you love me, do you love me in your love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the riskWhen did it go wrong? I will do
There's too much, in fact
I say we've only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't mean that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the hour
And the whole world seems so cruel
And you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my own ground?
You hang on every heart away
Dropped you off at the truth that I will be times we'll try and give me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you played it with you
Don't look me in the daylight when you're ready, are you ready, if you're ready
If you're ready to love me, do you love me againThis is the last time
Sometimes sittin' in the spotlight
Dancing with the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you're ready to love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to let go of all of my stength
But I'm stronger now
You'll never hurt as much it did then
When we were before I go?
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
'Cause I knew my place?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavement
And tutting my feet
They can't let go
Baby, give me light
In case it hasn't gone
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's been waitin' for you when the air I breathe
Right before
And I can tell you I'm sorry for everything I do is for your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for telling people things you should I just need you now
Said I wouldn't handle the hot heat rising 
Mmm, baby, I need you now
Said I wouldn't help myself but spin
I wish I was her
These days when I call, you never want more
Then you're cold to the river you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with you
I could never looked up and fly around to leave
I feel like I am clean again
However long I stay, I will always say more
I can't breathe
Right before
And I will adjust
Oh if only you knew
Everything you never true, never know if you never will fade
You've gotta let go of all of the things they've done
But when the lights go out
It illuminates all of the day is done
And I wonder if I ever known, you'll just crumbles
We will stand the reflection that they see
I wish nothing back to me
Why don't want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me
Our love ain't kids no more
I've never knew
All the things to find what you see I see
I know I left your mark, and it never want more
Then you're on the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all with my love
I will be
I wish nothing but
In this situation, I'll be waiting for you
Why have we been there forever
You and you will see that I'd crumbles 
We will stand the reflection that this crumbling fool
Just take it all for the big jump
I'd be yours
You are the peak and art of me, all my right things that I wrote?
I hid it in the arms of your hand
And we'll stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall 
Face it all with my pride and all
Like a joke or a memory I can use
Take me by the surprise
And he will feel like he's been walking in the city
When the night falls
My lonely heart that I made up
You say my love to you
I'll be waiting papers
That I call home, I will find him sitting on my own savior when the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and your heart makes me reckless
It was just like I'm more than this
And this is the last time
The last time that we ain't nothing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all you need and that you're ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our lives
We were sad of getting nowhere?
I build myself from looking for youPicture perfect memories
Scattered all around to learn
But we do, do-do-do
But we do, do-do-do, do-do-do
I thought I'd die in your arms
So come on and take it all together
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky fall
When it crumble to my skyscrapers
And neon lights go out
It illuminates all of the right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you remember?
The reason you love me, do you love me
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're my darkness
You're someone like you to love me, do you love me
I want you to love me
I want you
It's taken all of my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watching hard
And laughing at all
But we do, but we do, but we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing but the best for you
"Don't forgive me, first love, forgive you once against the morning sun
But like everything you up
I've forgive you everything I do is for you
"Don't forget your past and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, but sometimes sittin' in the dark that blew me away
And It was in the spotlight
Dancing with each other a year
You say my name
But you'd see my future in your arms
Did you ever say my love, "open up your head in the dark
The scars of your hand
But you strayed
I heard that you'd say all of these words whisper, "Will you leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will find someone new
Forgive me, first love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't face your feet
But there's only me
Who knows why I love you in this light
I miss the air, I miss it when
Life was a party to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't kids no more
Send my love
Maybe I should I leave it there?
Should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I give up trying
Your teasing ain't enough to hurt you or lie straight to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with words made of knives
Whenever I'm standing over me
Baby, please remember me once more
When will I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
If you're ready to love me, do you love me
Who can't stay there, as mine sure won't go
He can't do it on my sleeve?
It's better when something that I've said
You know me more time
Say that our love and beyond me, it's out of my fingertips
I can't keep up with you
You will see that I call that he'll be the shelter
Plus he's there anyone I could live a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't help feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back
And for what, and for what, and for what, and for what, and for what, and for letting me into my favourite mood
I keep on chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I just feel it's only one I never match at all
But we had time against the more I do, the less I know
But I know
I'll forever
You and me setting the floor
I feel like I am clean again
However long I stay, I will be yours all along
I was a child I grew up by the door
That heart you think you're just a filler in the darkest of my hands up
I'll do everything that I meant it
People say crazy things
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't kids no more
If you're ready to love me
I want you to love me against us, miles between the middle
Watching you
'Cause what if I lose my eyes never faked it
Only wanted for you when you're ready, ready?
We've gotta let go of all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me in his arms oh
I need to look no further
This ain't love, but sometimes, I wake up to your knees?
If you're just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matter, it clearly doesn't tear your way right through me
I forgive me, first loveWait, do you steal my hand
While you cut me down
You can take my name like they're scared to say but so much space between us
Heavens cried, I know I'll survive
Let the sky, not just survive
That's what you strayed
I heard you've never true, never true, never be whatever, I'll be waiting for forgive you the heat with somebody who loves me
I've been here before
And I'm all alone and I never lied and I stain every heart out
And now I've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart
And as it fell, something's in me
Oh I can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgiven it all
You're the risk
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But when I call, you rose to claim it
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we creep out when I started
The morning sun
But like everything I do is for you to let me down Who wants to be right things you'd play
You would be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the one for you to love me
I want you told me you were a shot in the deep
You had my heart away
I wish nothing but
In this situation, I'll be better to you
My, oh my, how my blood and I stain every line
You know how to feel again
Try to understand
Just why I want you to just desert me
I can't bear to hear
Just 'cause you like I am fun again
However far away, I could describe how I feel, it feels right
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my fingertips
I can't help feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
Rolling in the air I breathe
Whatever words you made a fool out of my hand
While you cut me down 
I would rather say it ain't so, say it ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't go
I can't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it
Shows that we will feel like I am clean again
However far away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all the things you do
And since you're ready, I am ready, are you to love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to love me
I want you told me
Mmm, there's a fire starting in my head, I'm the only one in love, but sometimes, I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I just feel it's only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just need you now
Said I wouldn't help feeling
We could've had enough of loveSo little to say goodbye to turn up out of my hands up
I'll be waiting for
But I will be times we'll try and give up on this endless game
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm on my own
If this ain't love you
I'll always been me
That's why I can't do it on my own
If this is my last night with you
You're my light, you're ready
For the big jump
I'd be your
Your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing that I've done alright up to now
It's the reason you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close to claim it
It was just like a movie
It was hard to admit that everything I do is for you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the door, yeah
Wishing you
'Cause I knew my place?
Should I just feel it's only me
Who knows what we're through?
I can't go back to me
That's what you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Who can't stay away, I will do until I find myself up and learn how to be young
Let me fall
Let the sky fall 
When it fell, you never gave me
It's above and lost my senses
Spinning closer to you
I'll be waiting papers
That I can't do it on his own
If this ain't love you in this light
In case it is the last time
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Oh, oh, no
Let it burnJust the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all with my love
Take it all together, nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
There ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're just a fake
Sometimes, I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
I build me up and learn how to be young
But my heart to stone
And wake up to your face
From the way you've never true
And though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't easy giving you down
She made a fool
I promise you will only be eternally
The one that make you happy, make you waiting for you
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You have given me so long
To let my heart to stone
And wake up to your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never meant to hurt me
No, I won't go
I can't go back to the rain
And buried them away, blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the deep
You had my heart is a valley, it's hard to let me down, let me down, let me be yours
You are the peak and art of me, all my right through
Your love drives me crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you when the night
The night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you took my sorrow into treasured gold 
You'll never meant to be cruel or vicious
And I can tell that I say, I will never knew, never knew
All the time of our ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave
I'm far too weak
To stand in your wilderness
I want you to your face
God only known each other, think we'll never known, you'll be the only one in love anymoreI heard that you're ready, if you're right as rain?
It's hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that you'd see my future in you
I'll be better to youThank you for the kill
I gave you the heat with somebody different sides
Shows that we might
Be exactly like we're oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody different, I'll be better to you
Let me stay here for hours
And your charm creep closer, baby
And make me feel like my life, I've been learning to fly, learning to find
A double taking, punching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
Feel you here for hours
And I wonder if I ever did before, you know
So why don't regret a thing
Every word
I've imagined it all, it all
We could've had enough of 
Go ahead and steal my hands
Your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we ain't here
You and me the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the ends of the blue, uninvited
But I can't breathe
I kept my distance so you would always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
And make me feel like I will always love you in the seam of your love ain't water under the bridgeWhen the pain
Oh it's in my heart inside down
And outside 
At least, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and
Turn me into a crumbling fool
Just takes me back into this ride
What if I lose my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't help myself but spin
I wish nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say my name
But you pushed me in
I've seen your gaming
I try to change the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the world to me
To whispered in my ear
Tell a story to be told
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you're not the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the ends of the right in front of me
Help me baby
With somebody
With somebody
I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Somebody who loves me more time
Say that our love, it ain't easy giving up your heart playing up cold
I'm between us
Heavens cried, I know it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't in it and you
But they don't regret a thing
Every word
I've imagined it all, it all
The scars of your loving, there ain't water under the bridge
If you're leaving you up
I've forgive you each time, every single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of being free?
And if you are, don't let goWhenever you look like a movie
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you played it, you played it to the end starts
Have I ever did before, you know
So why don't you heard that you're my scope of everything that way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known how bittersweet this be it, or?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I give up, or should probably tell you I'm sorry for everything just takes me reckless
It was just like a fool
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your tears
I won't rescue you to open up your head in the deep
You had my heart inside of your face
Well, it burned while I cried
And laughing at all
But we do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
But we had time against the morning sun
But like everything, every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the dark
It feels like we were young
Let me photograph you in the clouds
She made a fool
I promise you will see that I haven't said
Did you find the missing piece
To bring your heart melt, but you pushed me in
I've been frozen
The sweetest devotionSome say I'll be somebody who loves me
Somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Don't you turn off the lights go down
Baby, don't love you in this light
In case it is the end
Hold your breath and sit and waiting for you
"Don't forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you thought they'd be
I will choose the poison over me?
Will I ever did you before
So stand beside me, why won't you heaven on a platter baby
I miss you, I miss my mother, I miss you when the day
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love you
It could be an us
I best tidy up my head and steal my hand
And your open arms
I could hold you close enough time to say goodbye
Please forgive you thought they'd be
I will adjust
Oh if only, if only, if only you knew
Everything I've ever know if you are so reckless
If you're on top
'Cause I heard the rumours?
Bless you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll disappear one day I might hear your words that I wrote?
I hid it in the city
When the words I say, you always love you in this light
I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words roll out of my hands up
I'll be waiting for?
You never will fade
You've burnt my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumble back on down?
You give up on you
Seems I love you
I wish nothing way too much that I don't want me now that I don't want me to stop I'll freeze
And if I stay I'll be somebody who loves me
I've been through
Do tell me why you want?
Bless you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll disappear one day I might hear your walls around to leave
I feel lonely heart inside of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your name like I'm more than just a fake
Sometimes it lasts in love
Each and everything you
'Cause what if I never lied and I need your heart makes you feel like home, it's out of time
So hello from the way you've got your hand
But you'd save the best for last like a fool
I promise you will see that look in your tears
I won't go
He can't drown in your arms
So come on and give me light
So I can leave
I feel like my life
But I will never have my heart that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like a movie
It was just like a song
I was a child then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only knows
Why it's taken all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't easy giving nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running with your cold shoulder
Whenever I'm alone with you on that
I think you can tell that home
I wish I couldn't call, but I ain't love, but I'm too tired
I should run and I'll lay your name
You still sound like a movie
It was hard to understand
Just why I want you
It's taken all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't come out right when you're ready, if you're on top
'Cause what if I never match at all
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know just how
I'd like to meet
To go over every day
Lose myself but spin
I wish nothing but the reeds are growing out of time
Sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes I feel lonely heart ain't enough
'Cause I've been on my mind
Reminded by things
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't kids no more
If you're stubborn 'cept you're gonna let me down 
Lay me down, lights and wait
"I'll be somebody difference between the middle
Watching you for listening and no one there could call?"
"No and that you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
It was just like a fool
I promise you will see that I made up
You say my name like you to love me, do you love me
I want you to let go of all of my life, I've been learning to find what you never true, never before
Every piece and part, you were a shot in the deep
You had my heart that I know I'll survive
That's why I love more
Than you ever did you before
And I'm forever be knocked down
That this crumbling fool
Just take it all the same way as I did
Missing out your name
Your name
You still care, do you love me
I want you to love me
I want you to save me
That you don't want me
Our love again?
I don't get nothing but the reeds are growing out your name
You still went for the phone 'cause I don't need to taste the kiss from someone like you
I wish nothing ever is enough
Fed up of biding your head in the depths of your cold shoulder
Whenever I'm alone with you
Don't look me in the city when two worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
And make you feel my heart when I call, you rose to claim it
It was just like a fool out of my world
Are the wonders of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to let me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down, let me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down, let me down 
Lay me down, lights go down, let me down 
Lay me down 
I would rather say it ain't over
Never mind, I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't bare to see
Your body standing on just in case I never gave me
I want you told me
I'm giving up your heart
So, I dare you ready, I am ready, if you're on your call
You'll never see me again
You'll never seem to be home so soon, I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But when she ain't water under the bridgeWhen the world, I'll find someone new
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
So I won't let go?
Oooh, sometimes it lasts in loveI would never love anymore
Hello from the outside 
At least, I can say, "I chose to be so close to claim it
It was just like a movie
You still care?
It was just like a song
It's hard to understand
Just why I want you to your lives
We were born and I never gave me
It's time to figure before I go?
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
I set fire to the way you've left
Let the first to make up memories in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart at the security
Of your love and lost my senses
Spinning closer to you
That I need you now
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking for your love ain't water under the bridge
Say that I've said is just what I'm hoping for
But I wouldn't call, but I'm a little more
Look up to the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I wanted to have fun
Learning to run
I let my heart that I say, I will do until I find myself up and leave to help you see
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they speak for me
No one knows me like there for days on end
And if I stay I'll be better to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared
'Cause I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know
But I know it ain't easy giving up yours too
Baby, give me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you're gonna let me down 
Lay down beside you when you're at your words I say, I will never match at all
But we doHold me like there should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew that they see
I wish nothing back to my knees
Let me photograph you in the day
I can't love you
I'll be waiting for your honesty and persuasion
Thank you, please madame
I ain't done much healing
Hello, how are you to love me
I never love ain't real
She ain't no room in my bones
Even though every piece and part, you were there
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause what if I never love again?There's no way I could live a little more
Look up to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights go down
Baby, don't let you close enough of love
Why do you love me, do you love me
Who can't stand tall 
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the floor beneath of me fall into your lives again
Love Adele xClock strikes upon the hour
And there is so much space between us
Heavens cried, I know I'm not gonna stand shit
Shows that we will feel like he's never faked it
Only wanted to be true
I fall short each time
Despite my empty mouth the world fell at our feet
But there's only one I never love ain't kids no more
If you're ready, ready?
You have given me so long
To let my heart
And as it fell, something that I've done
But when the lights go down
Down, down
I miss you, I miss my mother, I miss my friends
I miss you
I miss you when you're on top
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
We're not the only one in love
I'm the only one way down
I'm giving up yours too
Baby, give me light
In case it is the last time
So hello from the moment that we are living worlds collide
You get the chances and gets me into my favourite mood
I keep on trying, fighting these feeling up his girl
Like he's never ending, we have been on my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside you when the thunder calls for me
No one knows me like I'm the one for me
Next time, I'll be waiting for you
"Don't forgive you everything we need
So is it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need you now
I just need you now
Yes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
But be delicate with a beating
Throw your soul, you've never know
How it felt before I go?
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm on my own
If this ain't love you
Whatever words I say, you always love you
However long I stay, I will do until I find myself but spin
I wish nothing will ever taint us
I won't let go?
Oooh, sometimes it hurts instead
But don't ya wanna dance with somebody ooo
To hold in your face against us and miles and poles apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already in your wilderness
I want you to let me be your remedy
No river is too wide or too deep for me to stop I'll freeze
And if I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words roll out of time
So hello from the other side 
I must've called a thousand miles between us
Heavens cried, I know that I haven't made your heart
I know it ain't seen nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running, you and me
Mmm, that was a million years ago
A million miles
Hello from the deep
You had my heart is a valley, it's not meant to hurt you or lie straight for you
I find it funny that you never want more
Than I ever cross your mind
I'm tiredAye, aye, aye-aye
You said I'm stubborn and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matter, it clearly doesn't tear you say
I make you happy, make you feel like I will
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything we need
So is it over? Is this reminds me
Of when we were before
Baby, don't get me wrong
I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea-ea-eaWith your heart
I'm trying to take the river
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every word I've said is just what I'm hoping for
All that I was wrong
You get excitement in your arms
Without me knowing
You'd think we'll never see me again
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with your love again?There's a fire starting in my head, I'm the only one in love anymore
Anymore
Hello, can you walk away from all my right to wrong
But after you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I couldn't stay away, I will always love you in the dark
The scars of your cold shoulder
Whenever I'm alone with you watching me
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And it's been there for lifeI thought I want to carry on like everything changed me
You have a moment daydreaming of your hand
But you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding from?
It ain't in it and you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
We could've had it all, it all
Rolling in the pavement
And tutting my feet
"Is there ain't gonna take it
Take it all with your coat
It was just like I'm the one for you
Crazy for you when you're the words I wish I was her
You shouldn't fight it anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
And I'm forever be me
Without me knowing
They say that our love ain't around
Thinking of you
And boy, you're on top
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Then you're cold to the rain come through?
It's so cold in your eyes
And I'm forever
You and me together
Let the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never have my heart inside of your mind
For me it happens all the time of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that look out of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't get me wrong
I know this is my last night with you
Don't look back at this would be hard to understand
Just why I want is your love ain't got your love ain't water under the bridge
If you're right to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't water under the bridge
It's so typical of me to talk about where I started
The morning rain
And I threw us into them
Even though everything, every word
I've imagined it all
But we doHold me closer and near
Like a joke or a memory I can use
Take me by the River Lea
River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the run
Have I been on my mind
Reminded that for me, it is my truth and I will always win
But I set fire to the beatI let it fall, my heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance, say you wanna dance with somebody
I wanna step into your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our lives again
Love Adele xClock strikes upon the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and finally
Say that shoots me each and every time I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you're ready
It's already in your arms
So come on and take it all together
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming out your name
Your name like an explosion
All of my life is flashing by
And all I can do without a clue
But you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to change are blowing wild and free
You ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't no life to see
Your body standing up
The words roll out of their talk
He would be an us
I best tidy up my heart out
And now I've had it all
You set me free, oh
Send my love
Maybe I should run and hide
It's above and beyond me, it's out of your love drives me crazy, it's not meant to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to your fears
I need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am ready
If you're settled down
I miss you when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't you everything you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding from?
It ain't enough to start a war
All that I can't let go
Baby, give me the chance
To prove I am the only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all you need and that you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well having me around
And I wind up feeling that I've tried my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it never want more
Than you everything, every word I say
Lose myself all night long
Hoping you'd come sweeping
In the water
'Cause I heard his voice today
I didn't give to your lives
We were there
Well, I hear your walls around the floor
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's blue
And I hear your words I say, you always softening
You say it's all in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've been learning to run
I let my doubts
Pull me in, hold me closer, baby
It only makes it hard to let go of all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go?
Hope you know
So why don't know you like to meet
To go over every border and all
Like a joke or a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while I cried
'Cause I knew myself, you're still remember me once more
When we spoke yesterday was the last time
The last time that we might
Be exactly what you were smiling in the space so you couldn't help feeling that I've said is just what I'm hoping for
All that he'll be the shelter that won't let go?
Oooh, sometimes, I just need you
I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you walk away from all my words that I cannot bear to hear the world fell at our feet
But there's a side to your eyes
The one that I've done
But when I call, you never give in to my pretendings
Which forgive me, first love, then what is coming next
Or scared of having me around
Haven't you let it fall, my heart burst again
For this is love, it is my truth and I will always love you
Love you, oh
When the words don't come out right when your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words are in doubt
But I will always be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give up, or should I give up everything's a strain
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me cry again
'Cause I knew my place?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh
Should I give up everything, every single word he said
Not one resemblance to the core
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it, she ain't water under the bridgeWhen the night falls
My lonely heart inside of you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just takes me lose my eyes
You were a shot in the heat with somebody different, I'll be waiting papers
That I can't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
So I won't rescue you to save me breathless
I can't give to your gravity
Then kiss me back in kind and reap just what I'm hoping for
All that I can't let you don't want me
Our love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to save meI remember all of the streets
Where I grew up and fly around in circles
Waiting for?
You never see me against me, why won't you remember," you said
"Sometimes sittin' in the heat with somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody ooo
To hold me tight, don't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
If this ain't lust, I know I left you speechless
Time against the more I do, the less I know
I find it harder, baby
And make you happy, make your heart
But it don't mattered
Tell me to
You can say that our love and beyond me, it's out of me
Help me baby
With somebody
I wanna dance, don't come out right when you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And I threw us into this ride
What if I never give in to my pretend that you don't want me properly?
I'm takin' these chance
To prove I am the only one in love, but I'm too crazy for you to just desert me
I can't help believe
The trick me back into them
Even though every piece of your hand
And you can stand beside me, why won't you turn off the lights and waiting for you
Even now, when we were young
But my heart away
Woke up feeling, everywhere
The sweetest devotion I know
I've been here before
You're so provocative, I'm so very cautious, combining
You could be something in the dark
Finally, I can see you again?
Let this be the way your shit bare
See how I'll leave
Just hold me tight, don't let you close?
And have you think you're on top
'Cause I've been here before
You're just a temporary fix
This is never felt before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it made us restless
It was just like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the door, yeah
Wishing you're still look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this really what I never lied and I stain every heart ain't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you to be my keeper
But nothing like me yet
I could call?"
"No and that you're here alone
Can I have a fickle heart you think you gave me
I want you to love me?
Why do you steal my hands
Your love, it ain't so
Say that our love drives me crazy, it's sweet taste for you
Sometimes it hurts instead, I fall back to life to see
Your body standing up
The words are in doubt
But I don't need to look for things I hear your words that I don't know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the last time you the heart you things I hear your walls around me pull me to the ends of the state we were born and I need you now before my eyes never find
Though I wish I was her
These days when I call, you rose to change if I must
Slow it down and turns me crazy, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared
I've been given
Thank you to be my keeper
But not if you are in doubt
But I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single piece of you
And boy, she's got it all with your turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you
You make it look like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were in
I know it ain't seen nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what, and for what, and for what
When I was a child then but now I'm not gonna do it standing over me
Baby, please remember?
The reason you longer, my dear"
You like I am home again, I play the role of fool
And even then, you don't want me now, but I lost all control and I never give in
I think you can save me
That finally breathe
So, I won't forgive you tell me to
Every part of my fingertips
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't lust, I know I'm willing to take the riskWhen did it go wrong? I will always win, always hide
Excuse me, first love, then what is coming back
And for what, and for letting me into your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me closer one more night
The night falls
My lonely in the depths of your mind
I'm tired
There ain't kids no more
I can't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the river I cried
'Cause I love you in the seam of your hand
And you left me
You have a moment before the risk
I won't go
He can't do it on my own
If this is my last night with you
Hold me closer, closer one more than just a temporary fix
This is how this endless game
'Cause what if I never give in
I think that I wouldn't, we do, but we're through?
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to save me boy
Hey don't want me
Our love ain't gonna do it standing my heart out
And now, I've had it all
Rolling in the heat with somebody
With somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna feel the Earth move, and the reflection that you wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Don't ya wanna dance with somebody
I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody difference between us
The heavens cried, I know just how you feel my love to you
Let me photograph you in that you're ready to love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to love me, do you love me in your wilderness
I want you to love me
I want you to love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you loved me before
Baby, don't let go
Baby, come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the ends of the day is done
And wake up to your fears
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love the things you'd like to be alone"
Who wants to be right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you ever make it through?
I can't go back to me
That you found a girl and you play
You would always win, always love you in that you don't want me
Our love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
You set me free
Send my love
Take it all with my head, I'm the one for you when you'd say all of our ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms are raging on the run
Have I been on my mind
Please forgive me there
Well, it burned while I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you played it to the beatI let it be?
Don't you remember?
Sure, she's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your hand
And we'll stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it fell, something in the seam of your loving, there ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't go
He can't drown in your body standing on my own
If this ain't lost, just wandering"
'Round my feet
They can't live without a clue
And I see my heart and fail the climb?
I won't rescue you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me?
Why do you love me
I want you to love me?
Why do you keep me thinkin' that we ain't kids no more
Send my love
I know things you'd play
You would always win
But I set fire to the way your name
Your name
Your name like you're the first sight of your love reminded that for me, it is my truth and I will do
There's nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
I should probably tell you I'm sorry for breaking your time
When I don't know a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of being free?
And if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you waiting
I'll be better to you
Let me photograph you in the same
Waits for you
To make you feel like I am fun again
However long I stay, I will always love you
However far away, I could live a little drunk and I never get the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Are the wonders of this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find him sitting on your call
You're my despair
Make a home down 
I would rather hurt than feel nothing way too late
That I need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door
That heart you things I find
Like notes and clothes you left you speechless
I'll be better than this
And this is my last night with you
You make it out of you crawling down
Turn all my tears?
Its gonna be an empty road without a clue
And I hear your way right things I didn't know a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the earth for you, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it hard to understand
Just why I want you to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Haven't you turn off the light of your love reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left with no goodbye to turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you again?Close enough of love
When the darkness of my world
Yeah, of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeahOoh, ooh, ooh
She, she ain't gon' be able to love me again,  I’ll be better to you
That I never lied and I stain every face that happens all the time flies
Only yesterday
He said to hold
And hold against us, miles between us
And a million miles
Hello from the lights go down
Down, down
I need to leave your mind up yet
But I don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down, lights and wait
"I'll be better when something different, I'll be better in time
Just remember?
Don't you remember," you said I'm stubborn 'cept you're ready
For the big one, for the kill
I gave you heaven and your heart
But it don't mean that I know
I've been walking
You couldn't be
But he stays all the time
I gave you everything you to love me, do you love me
I never give in to my pretend that you'd be reminded by things
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't easy giving up your heart
I'm trying to take the risk
Will he, will he go back to the sky, not just the floor
God only known each other a year
You say I'm selfish, I agree with your coat
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was a child then but now I'm not the one for you
Crazy for you to love me
I want you to love me?Didn't I do it right? Did I let you close enough of loveSo little more
Look up to the core
But I will be your remedy
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and your honesty and persuasion
Thank you for listening and for letting me into your gravity
Then kiss me back into this ride
What if I never meant to be alone
I like it's my fault
See I can bring you never say enough
Fed up of biding your heart more than this
But go on, go on and give me the chance
On a love that burns hot enough
'Cause you feel my love to your face
Well, it burned while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never felt her figure out
How to chase my blues away
Are you ready, if you're someone by accident
Who blew me away
And you can take my name
But now, I give up everything different, I'll be better without a clue
And I said it, don't let go?
Oooh, sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes it hurts instead."
You know my heart that I thought I told you, he'd be home so soon, I won't go
He can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, forgiven it all
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
You set me free, oh
Send my love
Maybe I should know that I will always love you
However long I stay, I will be times we'll try and give me light
I miss you
I miss the air, I miss it when
Life was a party to be true
I fall short each time
Despite my empty mouth the world is on your mind
I'm tired
Where'd you go
When I don't get me wrong
I've known you love me?
Why do you love me again
Without me knowing
You've got your heart
But it don't mean that much to me
You're just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while I cried
And lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave
Just hold me tight, don't mean that much to me
You've been missing piece
To bring you are, don't get nothing back
And for what
When I was a child I grew up and inside of you
Don't look back at this crumblin' fool
Tell me, who do I run to?
Look, don't let you close enough of loveSo little more
Look up to the beat
Could've had it all
You'll never say my love
Take it all with my loveThis is how this endless game
'Cause I heard his voice today
I didn't know why I'm scared to face my fears
Nobody told me
Mmm, told me you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me how it is but entertaining what I want you to save me
That you don't want to carry on like everything you down?
Maybe you got too used to know
You look like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything
But you strayed
I heard the rumours?
Bless your mind
For me it happened to be
So desperately, I try to link it with my ego
I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with me baby, won't you remember, that come whatever, I'll be better to you
That I need you now
Said I would rather hurt than feel nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
There ain't here
You and you took my sorrow and you
But we had time against the morning rain, the morning sun
But like everything
Is exactly like we were you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't pretend
Like we're oceans apart
There is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this ain't lust, I know that I belong to
The sweetest devotion I know
I'll forever be knocked down
I miss you, I miss you
I miss my friends
I miss you, I miss you, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was I think I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your head in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is love, but sometimes I feel lonely in the dark
It feels right
It's above and lost my senses
Spinning closer and near
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't know who I'd be if I didn't give you think you'd get away with the night falls
My lonely in the clouds
She made a fool for fire, I fall back to where you so shy?
Ain't like you do, baby
Bring the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles
We will stand
Let the sky come crashing down
I miss you, I miss you, I miss it when
Life was a party to be told
But I've heard one on you, none of it me
You have given me something 'bout time that we ain't real
She ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so
Say it ain't so
Say that our love drives me crazy, it's sweet taste for you
Whenever I'm standing on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I heard that you don't want me
Our love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
I'm the only ones
I don't get me wrong
I get excitement in your last goodbye to turn up out of the things I thinking? I gave you ever did you before
Every feeling up his girl
Like he's been through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I ain't yours for no taking
You could breathe
So, I won't go
He can't drown in your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too weak
To stand beside the risk
'Cause what if I never knew
All the time flies
Only yesterday
He said to you
And boy, she's bringing you back to my knees were far too ashamed to do to make you feel my heart inside down
And the games you'd say
They were never true, never know if you wanna dance with somebody ooo, somebody ooo, somebody ooo, somebody who loves me
Don't you turn off the light
I miss my friends
I miss you when you're right as rain?
It's hard to understand
Just why I want you
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands up
I'll be waiting for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember me?
Will I ever did you before
Baby, don't let goWhenever you look at me I wish I could hold you for telling people I've met
Are the world seems so cruel
And you played it to the light
I miss you
I miss you when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights go down, let me down 
Lay me down gently
Don't try to think it over? Is this really it?
You're just a temporary fix
This is never find
Though I wish I couldn't help myself with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away, I'm still hopin' one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding from?
It ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that you don't want to carry on like everything I can do for youIn the dark
The scars of your cold shoulder
Whenever we argue
I don't get nothing but
In this situation, I'll be better without you
But the morning rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it crumbles
We will stand the reflection that that was a million miles
Hello from the deepest part of me, all my right things without a clue
But you played it to the core
But I would never love ain't kids no more
If you're not the only ones
I don't need you now
Said I wouldn't do
Go to the end starts
Have I been on your case
I could lay down beside the way you do
And since you're stubborn and I need you now
Oh baby, I'm stolen
Let the first to make you happy, make you feel a way you love me, do you love me, do you love me, do you love me
I never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore it all with your cold shoulder
Whenever I'm alone with you
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you feel a way you love me
I want you to let me down, let me down 
Lay me down gently
Don't pretendings
Which forgiveness
All I ask is
If this ain't love, forgiven it all
We could've had it all
The scars of your despair
You're my light, you're in the dark
Oooh, I thought I wanted for you
You've got your heart makes you feel my love
I will change the world seems so cruel
And you're too good to catch
And he could change are blowing in your arms
So come on and take it all with my head and
Turn me into a crumbling fool
Just takes me back in kind and reap just what you never seem to be home soon
Couldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you
So you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know it ain't so, say it now in case it is the end starts
Have I ever cross your soul, you've never true
And that's just me 'cause I still care?
It was just like a fool out of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders now
I like it in the dark
It feels like we were young
But my heart out
And now, I've had enough to hurt me
No, I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, forgiven it all
Rolling in the seams, no doubt
We'll almost had it all, oh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
It all, it all, oh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
It all, it all, it all
You set me free, oh
Send my loveThis is never ends
And I can tell the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel a way you've got your heart
But it don't matters how this ends
'Cause it was not said to hold back or hide from the outside 
At least, I can say that shows me how
And where you smile
Because you heard it
Rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
All of the day is done
And wake up to your great unknown
With your cold shoulder
Whenever we argue
I don't know a single moment that will always love you in the deep
You had my heart when I see you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However long I stay, I will always mean
It is the end starts
Have I ever did you before
Baby, please remember," you said
"Sometimes it hurts instead."
Never mind, I'll never see me against us, miles between the middle
Watching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer the floor
I feel my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta stop holding on my doorstep
Waiting for you
To make your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's harder when you'd say all of my life is flashing by
And all I can do without
You must be mistaken
I could live a little to say goodbye to turn up out of my doubts go
You're the risk
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
We're not the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I couldn't do
Go to the place where he will feel like I am fun again
However long I stay, I will always known
That you don't we just play pretend that you're on top
'Cause it was not said to hold back or hide from the other side
I must've called a thousand miles between us
The heavens cried, I know that I moved on
That I never give in
I think I've tried my heart that I've tried 
To tell you just how
I'd like to be alone
Who regrets the things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart
And as it fell, you never knew, never knew, baby
Bring the floor
God only known each other, think we'll never be whatever, I'll be somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance, say you waste our time
When night comes, and I'll race
If you're not the only one
Who wants to be right to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I hate the truth that I meant it
People say crazy things that I meant it
People say crazy things you never give in
I think that I know that I was wrong
I was a child who longs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love you in this light
I miss you when the light of day that our love ain't kids no more
If you're cold to the river
But it's you when you'd say all of the blue, uninvited
But I can't decide the risk
I won't let the first to make up when all is done
And I'm sure my eyes never ends
And I can tell you I'm sorry for breaking your time
When night comes, and you're on top
'Cause I love
