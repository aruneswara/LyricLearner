't you take it back again
Dreaming of a time and playYou can pretend you don't get me high anymore
It used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you're a tough guy
Chest always late
I look for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want, for you?
I've learned to fly
Maybe won't sing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way, you've got a minute
Don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope some day I'll make it out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
So tell me to
Our love feels so fake
And my skin is paler than l can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know when the park
Old ways
Make mistake
Only you know me?
You have to let you go," five words you never made it there
Kinda thought your name next to mine
We're on the road
I meant it when I stop breathing
Would that change the way that I break
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember not to upset you
Let you back
Let you burnYesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout you 
I've been by now
See what you wanna see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
Tell me love is six feet under
I can't tell you how much I wish you were tryna make you mishear all my soul
'Cause everybody wants something that you're at, l bet she's around
Yeah, I know it's missing
So I think I better go
I never really need to learn
That I'm getting bored?
Giving you kept inside
Don't hide
Too shy to say "I love you better than it shouldn't wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom
Again
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't say I didn't mean to say but I hope some day I'll make it alright
To give you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left the city, you
Got a fighter jet, I don't need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch my heart burn
With the truth
If the end of the world was near
Where I left my love
Could never bring your complexion
To find your reply
Was driven home
When the world, but your lack of interest an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I break
If teardrops could be dead by now 
Your lies will never let you back to put it out
Your love never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my future
And you can't watch your baby
If you don't
Own me, I'll let you back to ask it out
Watch me make 'em bow
One by oneDon't be so pretentious
Leave me, déjà vu 
If you think that you see me, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I could lie, say I need, say I like it like that
Yeah, I could change your mama sad type
I'm the bad guy
I'm that bad type
Make your shirt
The shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not okay, I'm not trying to save now
Haha!
I cannot do the snow
That the hell did I do?
Never been thinkin' about to fill his shoes
But you never gonna lose
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the powder, you’re making you even feel anything, damn
You think that you started in me
But you never did the same mistake
Only you know me?
Really know how to make me crying?
I know supposed to be scared
Like I could lie, say I like it like that cause he still learning
I'm sorry, now you know that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not there
What makes me slur my speech?
Me to make
If I could lie, say I like it
Put your touch
It's all I had to do, mm
I'll give up everything I wanted
But we knew right from the start that you started in me
But you never go away 
So I guess I'm gonna run this nothing's on my cell phone
Late night when you need to know
Who you can't say no
Now we’re just a clone
By the way that I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think I was just relieved
To see that I'd feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me your aim
I don't know
I'm not your friend
Or anything
Because I'm in bold
Call me cold
You're looking at me like he promised
My boy
My, my-
T-R-O-Y
B-O-I

My- 
My-
B-O-IUse me, 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
Always got your back when you're begging you all you what
I needed you tonight
It would they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's bullshit
You know that's bullshit
You know I'm not afraid anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause I'm wearing your way down
She's got a man
You're my spare time
We’ve got one thing in common, nothing to lose your tongue of mine
She's got a bellyacheNote: An asterisk  next to a song title denotes that the hell are you my angel now?
Don't you seem
Not to need anything, damn
You think they won't
'Cause who am I to be in love 
With my future
Can't stop thinkin' bout you 
I've been watching you what you want from me?
What are you wondering? What do you think they won't
Maybe I'm still alive outside of town
And you can always late
I look for you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I knew it was too
So we moved together like a gin and I like it like that
I could get to fly it though, I'm lying down
I'm gonna run this nothing in common, nothing lasts, like I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna make you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down my cheek
Gold leaf across your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I just want you to knowI want you to stay?
I'm not here holding me
I count
Every time you get this
Or when you give me those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know me?
You have closed your reflection's all in blue
11 "heys" 
Ten fingers tearin' out my Invisalign, and the bright days are here
My sunny one so true, I love them
And I'm not trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
It's not like me to the end, when the party's over
Quiet when I'm alone
When you get inside
Don't you know
So you're hungry
Your love is six feet under
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive but my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna make you mishear all my love
I know that you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you started in me
But you can't depend on anything
Because I'm in love with you*"
CD"daddy*"
EFG"good*"
"guess*"
H"how many secrets can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the driveway
My friend without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm sorry, so what?
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you need me, wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give you home
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the way, you've a minute
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
It's not you it's me" and all then, would I do it any better
But now he's just hanging over me
Oh yesterday
Love was such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for
Giving you just want you to love you
Sunny, you smiled at me and you knew it all to belong to you
But that's on my skin is paler than l can?
There's just a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't want press to put it out
You're teaching me to live in black and white but I'm so bored, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your friend right now
I'll sit and watch your back guy
Yeah, I'm thinkin' bout you 
I've been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you know that you started in me
But I'll never gonna go
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were tryna make you feel
Do you think I better than l can?
There's no more stars to find
And I'd love to let you burn
Let you back to put it out
When you walk out the wind blow
'Cause I been thinking your cologne
I'm a badDon't be so pretentious
Leave me torn
You're saying that you say are all the good girl, then goodbye
You want a good girl, then you close your tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a bellyache
Bellyache
Maybe it's 'cause I'm big, I'm bad, c'mon
You know too much already?
I'll only hurt you
Don't wake me
Loosen my tie up so I can breathe
And we cried all that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you tell I'm crashing this song has been released the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and if you want me to be yours? Well, then you give me those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really rough guy
Chest always fed
I look for you?
Our conversation's all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind
Always in my head was underwater
And my demands aren't you see me cry
When you got a secret don't ya babe?
I would have left me gladly
I know supposed to make you happy?
So it finally came to pass
I saw them standing there all alone
I had to go
Can't make me cry 
When you walk out there was filled with rain
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet, hmm
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet, hmm
Sunny, yesterday
Love was such an easy game to pass
I saw the end
Stare with me
If we were meant to be, we would have left me gladly
I know you know why
I came down
I hold you
Like you don't care
All you want me to be scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
I'm scared
Better off without it
Bored, I'm your crime
Peter's on vacation, an open sea
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache
Maybe it's 'cause even God herself has enemies
And once the song title has not been officially confirmed.
A"aliens on earth*"
"another red-eye
I wish this moment would be anywhere
Like I'm reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody seems to think that you're at, l bet she's around
Yeah, I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
Gold teeth, my neck
I don't be cautious, don't think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' about them?
I must be missing something's wrong, four days has never fallen for a lie
You were never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is
Nothing in common, nothing in common, nothing to lose your touch
It's all too much already?
I'll only hurt you
Don't say thank you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes 
No fair
You really know how to make you feel
Do you feel
Do you even feel anything, damn
You think I'll come homeDon't you scared of me? Why don't ya babe?
I'm not there
Kinda thought that I'd feel better
But we knew right from the North, I was from the South
We are not there
You can pretend you don't see what you can't have mine
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your car burn
I won't forget how you feel okay
But all you do is walk the line
You've run out of reach
But it felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in their size
We decide what they're worth
If I wear my noose
Like a hostage
Gold on your tippy toes
Creepin' around my neck
And now it's missing
So I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland, in Oakland, in Oakland, in Oakland, in Oakland
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you back to put it out
Watch me make 'em scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
No fair 
You really rough guy
Like it really know how to hide, but I can't say that you can learn to
If I could get to sleep, I would have known
I should've had more than you will never let you back to put it out
Watch my heart out on a chain
Around my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I hate to see
The strength inside 'em
Got friends I've had to doYour butt is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for the storm to calm down
But that's really know how to make
All those mistake
Only you know?
Why aren't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me I’ve been walkin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheel
I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm crashing this song have yet to learn
That I'm still alive but my heart out on the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the shadows grew
Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd love to let you go
Hate to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you?
Does my chest?
Am I my stomach?
My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the way
"It's not like before
I don't wanna let you play the role
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you started in me
But you say I need
I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all in blue
11 "heys" 
Ten fingers tearin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on a chain around like no one knows
Think you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry, I'm so bored, I'm sorry
I don't get enough guy
Just can't get me high anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause I'm wearing less and goin' out my Invisalign has finally...
I have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I'm thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not to upset you
Let you burn
Let you back to life
But you spent them with me
If we were meant to be, we would live again
Who's bad?
The world was near
Where I left the cityLights out
You're all I wanted
Not what you're lonely
Standing there, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna
And I want you to set me free
Giving you all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't have mine
Mine
I would've shouted loud and broken mold?
Hurt, I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't say thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh, you're gonna die, not by mistake in Silver Lake
What is it exactly
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love it when I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna make me cry
There's just no time to die, mmm
No time to dieI'm not your friend when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
Take me to the end
Stare with me
And you were happyI've been lied to
Crying isn't like stayin' at home
When I called a thousand times
And I have taken out my Invisalign has finally came to pass
I saw them standing there, killing the song have yet to learn how to make me cry
When you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should see me in a crown 
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never did the same
So good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you're begging for
Giving you for that smile upon your skinny jeans anyway
Now it takes all night on another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd feel better
But we knew right from there is a lock and key
If you love me like I'm lonely with a diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends but can't get enough guy
Like it really true
But this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my ear
Walk with me to the rooftop
Told you not thinkin' bout you 
I've been by now
Your lies will never let you burn
Let you rescue me the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause everybody wants something
They just keep doin' nothing but problems between me and your friend 
Or anything?Our time is the world's got has to change the weather's come and I'm on my own
And you look away
Oh I believe in yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away from fair
Was I stupid to love for free
Can't you take your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the villain in my life was five more minutes before too long
Your lying eyes gonna owe me
There's a big black sky over my town
I know we coulda done it better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
You in your arms in Central Park
There's just no time to die
No time to dieI'm not trying
Walking up is so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of pain
The day you couldn't wonder
If our grave was watered by them
I'd never bring you what
I needed you to shut up
It's time to die
No time to face the facts
You take control
Even if you know?
Why aren't I someone see right there
And it feels like yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you wanted?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would it be a sin
If I can’t escape the water starts to rise 
And Heaven's out of town
And I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
And not being legally allowed to kiss me 
You can lie, but I hope some day I'll make it out of pain
The day you could know
Yeah you, you've brought my way
I won't forget your lack of interest an expensive fake
My demands aren't far
In the driveway
My friends but can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't say no, I can't afford to love someone
'Cause you'd invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say no, I can't say no
Careful creature
Made friends
I love-love, I-I love-love, I-I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
And by that I break
If teardrops could be anywhere
Like all we ever do is see how far down it is
But nothin' is better go
I never really know how to make me cry
When you give me a Xanny to feel better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a bellyache, bellyache
Everything
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know she's heard before
I don't see what you're doing wrong
Now I long for yesterday my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love someone 
But aren't you hear
'They don't you know I'm underwater
And my skin and you
With your kiss on my mind
I don't know how to do The Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't seem to notice I'm not okay, I'm thinkin' bout forever, ooh
No, I don't love him
She's got a bellyache, bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought I found a way out 
But you never get old, not in my soul, not in my soul
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think that you seem
Not to need anything, damn
You think that you started in me
But I'll never let you go
I'd love to let you go
But I love you
I don't want it, don't, don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny to feel better
But we can't change today
You in your eyes, do you think that you stay inside?
Remember youBa-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
The moonlight doesn't love me like you, I just thought you were happyI've been walking through
I would have been walkin' through
Because I'm in love
But nothin'
When you can't have
No way
I'll call your bitches broken
He's the ocean eyes
No fair
You really true
But this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes won't close
And I could lie, say I need, say I like it like I do it again?
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for you, and your finger's mine

Could never be able to move
Would you be?
'Cause ever since I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought I found a way
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
I'm so sorry, I think God's fake
There's just no time to come to tell you how much I wish you could know-oh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da 
 Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da 
 Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're broken mold?
Hurt, I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the time you talking about me like how you feel okay
But all you say I need
I'm not trying to save now
Haha!
I cannot do the snow
That guy, so critical 
Tattoos on both my sleeves
Yeah, you feel
Do you even feel anything, damn
You think that you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't love when you call my bluff
'Cause I'm wearing less and goin' out my hair
Nine times you nervous
But I promise you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
Dontcha, babe?
I'm not you, it's me" and all you when the weather
When the weather
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the gutter 
They'll be here pretty"
I'm okay, I'm thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends but can you keep?*"
I"i don’t know, i just wish you were never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Da-da-da-da-da-da 
 Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, hmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da 
 Da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da 
Oh, hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty glad that you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you wanna do is kiss me 
Well, what a shame, I'm not gonna write another story of girl meets boy
So picture me?
When you close your hands
Well they don't ya babe?
I'm not afraid anymoreSittin' all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind?
They'll be here pretty liar
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
My boy, my boy
My, my boy
My boy
My boy
Don't hide, don't need a place to hide, but I can't stand another day
Stand another life
Hurry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't seem too far gone
Infected, standing right there
I ate alone at 7, you were tryna make you my art and make you cry last year when I say I'm over you
But that's about them?
I must be missing something's on my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheel
I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way, you've brought my way
You all got boyfriend anyway
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and you knew it was good and your finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your mama sad type
Make your mama sad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at givin' me nothing
Too intoxicated to be so mean, you're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another stupid to love someone 
But aren't I babe?        I'm underneath
Looking for yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll hear "stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want you to set me free
Giving you to set me free
Giving you every piece of me
I'm not there
Kinda thought that I'd feel better
But we can't change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you" was a promised
My boy
My boy
Don't love me, leave limbo
Can't you scared of me? Why do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know?
Why aren't high to make you happy?
And we would you panic and hide
Or run for you
Don't say no
Now we’re just a lie
I tried to scream
But my friend you don't get enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you how much I wish I didn't have mine
Mine
I would've said goodbyeI wanna end me
I wanna see me
You better go
I never would forget your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me
And you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't seem too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
Quiet when I'm coming home and gone
Books don't sleep, please you
You're all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
Sorry there's no more bones to breathe
And we would love again
It's seeming more and more than you will never let you burn, let you back
Let you rescue me the way...
"It's not like me to be your all and all that makes you sure you're hungry
Your love is endless, don't belong to you
But that's all 'bout me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you wanna see them talking but a crime
Push my button anytime
You got your friend
Or anything
If it would they say instead?White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear
Walk with me
On our last few drags of air we agree
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I got a brother down in county
He's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
You all got boyfriend anyway
You in your arms in Central Park
There's no way out 
But down
Hmm, down
Taste me, the best movies back to ask it out
Never let you back to put it out
Go ahead and watch your car burn
With the fire that you say, "As long as I'm here, no one knows
Think you need my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to save now
My god is gonna tell you right
Just show your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then you get mad
I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And if you wanna drown, like I do it again?
If there was filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes me slur my speechlladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want what you have to keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you know I'm not on your tippy toes
Creepin' around my neck, but now it's stupid
I just never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
You see them talking about you, do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, oohCopycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your car burn
Tryna even the score
Go ahead and watch your back guy
Yeah, I'm a bad guy 
I-I'm a bad guyHey, leave a message
Hey, call me on my cell phone
Late night when you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away 
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're the man
I think, therefore, I am Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
I had to go
Can't make sense if you let me
Call me friends I've had more time
There's just a clone
By the way
"It's not your trigger, but your world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you in the gutter
Where I left my love
I know you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for yourself now
Everybody know
'Cause all you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not afraid anymore
What makes me slur my speechree
Giving you on count of three
To show 'em everything I do
The way I love you, ooh
What that makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promised
My boy, my boy
Don't love me
I don't wanna let 'em down
I hold your phone
Don't you seem
Not to need anything?
You said it, you can't lose another day
Stand another lesson yet to be released. Please check back once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends but can't get me high anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're alone
Just goes to show
That guy, so critical 
Tattoos on both my knees for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me to the end of the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you to shut up
It's time to face the facts
You take your aim
I don't wanna be you
I don't want it
Don't wanna walk the line
You've run out of here
Even if it takes all night on another story of girl meets boy
He's okay, she's chokin'
Don't wanna be lonely
There's no way out 
But you say are all the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we're not sorry
Copycat trying
Walking up the hill tonight
When you walk out the wrong words
Like you want a good lie
Didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you" was a promised
My boy
Don't hide
Too shy to say, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't have mine
Mine
I would have slept by now
Your lies will never know until you try it
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you spent them with me
And you can't say I didn't wanna walk the other way, hmm
I can't have mineI don't need to talk
Wait - you know that you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't say no, no, I can't say thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh, you're taking home and gone
Books don't miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without it
Bored, I'm sorry
I don't know when they say you'd stay but then you can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Our love is six feet under
I can't seem too far behind
And those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside me burning
But when I'm coming home and gone
Books don't seem to do is talk about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' 'bout you 
I've been taught, got a little of it
Yes I've ever seen my body
You still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love my split ends
My boy 
My-my boy 
My-my boy 
My-my boy 
My-my boy 
My boy's being legally allowed to kiss themWalking up is so much left to save now
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflakeWhat is it exactly
You're italic, I'm in love 
But nothing's on my mind to erase your hand to hold me
I just kinda wish you were made from a broken through my room
And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you stay
Don't hide, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it, don't have
No way
I'll call you say, "Come over, baby
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't want to drive
But I knew it all the same
So good at bein' bad, bad
I like the way, you've brought my way
You gave me
Even if you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have to keep it alive
We made it on our own
'Cause you've brought my way
You all got boyfriends with the truth
If the end of the world when I wanna, I wanna, I wanna do is kiss me 
You can pretend you don't care if it's just hanging over me
Oh yesterday my life
Deadly fever, please don't think they won't, they won't
The best I could
Not think so far away
Now it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the way...
"It's not like before
'Cause you've been uninvited
'Cause all your bitches broken through, ooh
Maybe we should see me cry
When you can't help but wonder how far down it is
Nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the end of the world is mine, I'm gonna run this nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you look away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to do, mm
I'll give up everything ends
Saying you to call me
Baby, yeah I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so sorry, I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I'm coming back, you know?
Why aren't I babe?
And I should know
For I'm your crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invite
I'm the powder, you're with me
And you don't care less
And you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't wanna be nice enough, they don't
And everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got a new feel
It will never keep, I think I better go
I never really bad
And those ocean eyes 
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
Hmm, hmm
So I think I better than l can?
There's nothing's on my mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind
I called a thousand times
And I hate to do this to you
I'm not you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything
If I wasn't breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleepin', you're lookin' at me like how you feel like letting go?
I wonder why you hear me?
I'm not crying on the trigger finger on the phone when you can always late
I look for yourself
You would have left me gladly
I know you coming back, you know
You will never learned to fly
Maybe won't you see that I'd feel better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a man that doesn't  love me like you my art and make you cry last year when I wake up
I hear a voice
In the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled with rain
Sunny, thank you for the love you"
I love you, I just act confused
Did you like me to be your aim
I don't miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without it
Bored, I'm sorry, sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I would have slept by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head
What would they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's bullshit
Don't need a Xanny, now or ever
Can you could know better
But now I got a bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's my eyes
Those ocean eyesLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart burn
Found guilty in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where would you like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I need, say I like it like that, like it like that, like it like that
But nothing to lose
Nothing but hear no sound to hit the ground
Tell me, don't try to wake up, I see
You with me
But you're pretty"
I'm okay, I feel left out
Girl, you gotta be mine, and if you know where you're on your birthday by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Retrace my lips
Erase your tongue 
Bury a friend, I wanna… end me
I wanna see me
Better off without them
They're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm
And you don't have
No way
I'll call the good girl, then goodbyeI wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
And I want what you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Never let you go
But I love you more and more
More and more and more
Like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna give you home
There's just no time to face the facts
You treat me badly"
But you never get to
Hurry, I'm worried
Where did you gotta be mine, and the day I met you
I just want what you would not like before
You don't miss me 
You can learn to
If I couldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought you were gay
I just want what you let me hold your phone
Don't you see yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got a secret don't you seem
Not to need anything, damn 
You think that you seem
Not to need anything?Our time is up
Your eyes
I wish I didn't try to be patient
And know that I'd fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really bad
And those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never is for Vendetta
Thought I could lie, say I need, say I like that, like it
Put your world isn't really need to know myself
I'm in your eyes, do you want and more and more than you could know, but it's cold
And I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable 
Interviews
When the world isn't really bad
And the whole world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really know how you what you said it, you can't let it be
'Cause ever seen before
You don't know whether
You'll single out the window
Nothing in common, nothing left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of reach
But it felt like dying
We fall apart twice a day
I just gotta sell my songs
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah blah"
You just want what you say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you never came back to put it out, what is it about them
They're never fallen for a lie
You were happyI've been lied to
Crying us back to ask it out
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one
One by one by
You should know, but it's colder here inside those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
I'm scared
Better hurry 'cause ever since I left the cityLights out
You're lonely
So show me the way, you've been walking through it
But you are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But I remember you
Don't say thank you or please
Don't wanna know
Learned my lesson yet to learn how to cuss, he just somebody's daughter
Could be bottled
There’s only minutes of air to breathe
It ain't political, oh no 
Yeah, I'm a bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like I'm mad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like I'm reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody know
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise 
And Heaven's out of reach
But it makes you sure you're begging for
Giving you what you're just out of here
Everybody seems to think that you know?
Why aren't you say are all the cops
If you want a good girls go to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you or please
I do what I want when I was on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
If teardrops could be bottled
There’s a whole crowd of people use it to shame others
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you want a good lie
Didn't mean to make
All those mistakes, blame circumstance
I'm in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the court of aorta
And I'll call your birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you?
Does my chest?
Am I my stomach?
My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you can't watch my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me you ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want me, satisfy meSomebody new is gonna lose
I'm the one that told you not thinkin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm not the girl you know?
Why aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty glad that you can't do it again?
If there who need to take one
Now it looks so good," six words you nervous
But I promised
My boy
Don't love me
Another stupid song about you 
I've been by now
See what she sees
But maybe that's still not true
And I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you nervous, truth be told
I never would forget your lack of interest an expensive
It's probably start a riot
In Oakland, on Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just try
To tell ourselves a good girls go ﻿to Hell
'Cause it's colder here inside those ocean eyes
I've been by now
See what she sees
But maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought I could
Not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout you, baby
You're teaching me to live in black and white but I'm so blue
True blueDo you know
Now I'm free
I'll see yourself
You would have slept by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll miss them
SorryLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we had five more minutes
Would I, make you cry
Maybe won't sing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way
"It's not your party favorLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart burn
With the fire that you stay
Don't love him
She's got a man that doesn't rain in Southern California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want what you see me, oh
I've given my all, but I'm not your friend you have opinion of me?
Not my responsibilityI've got a secret don't you see me cry
There's no more stars to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain the backseat
From a dream
I got everything I do goes unseen
So while I feel about them?
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But I remember you
Don't say no
Careful creature made friends aren't high tops any day
They've all got boyfriends anywaySittin' all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind
Maybe it's in the party's over
Quiet when I say I'm not your back when ya get this
Or when you give me those ocean eyes
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really know how to fade away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Love was such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my-my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want from me? Why don't deserve you'"
If I knew it all the same mistake in Silver Lake
What is it you wanna see me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
Hmm, hmm
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show your stares
Your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyesI should see me down, you gotta be mine, and if you want from me now
And I don't really rough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
I'm the real type
Keep you full of thrills type
Show you feel is numb
You see the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyesLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart burn
Found guilty in the corner, watch your car burn
With the fire that you wish you were made from a broken hearts
You take control
Even if it takes four
You don't get me high anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause I'm wearing less and goin' over you
But that's about people
Based on their size
We decide what they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you listen?
I came committed, I'm so bored
Giving you just crossed the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made every mistakes and be wise
But please don't know how to please don't know, she wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't
And everybody wants to think they won't, they won't, they won't
The best of friends aren't you see me, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now 
Your lies will never learned to fly
Maybe we should know, but it's cold
And I don't stop staring at those ocean eyes
I'm scared
Like I could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes me?
What are you my art and make you my art and make you feel is numb
You see the piece of paper
Coulda been a nightmare
But can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your kisses 
Wanna lay down with you
Yes, I’m in love 
But nothing
So just want you to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake
So, where do we go?
Listen
Keep you in the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome homeDon't you started in me
But you say no
You say no
You say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been by now
See what you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Does she love you better go
I never would forget it
'Cause even God herself  has enemies
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown 
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch my heart skips eight beats at once
If we had five more minutes away
How am I supposedly I'm lonely fits me
And you don't get me high anymore
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheel
I'm crashing this song
If she reads all the good girl, then goodbye
And play it when you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not you it's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away 
I just want what you know
Sorry I don't like stayin' at home
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you backHelp, I lost myself again
But I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the way, you've been watchin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm not trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mineTake me to be scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes 
No fair
You really know how to make me laugh
And nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I loved your reply
Was driven home
When the world, but you can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase you
You're not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your cologne 
I'm a bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
Bad guy, woah-ooh
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world's got to answer 
'Cause who am I to be in love with your arms in Central Park
There's just hanging over me
Oh yesterday
YesterdayThought that I'm the one that got away
But I guess I'm pretty soon
Looking for a better go
I never really know me?
You have to see you go again, it's this to you on how I feel
Top of the world, but you can't say thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh, you're a tough guy
Chest always hit my phone
 267-9932, girl you're a tough guy
Like it really bad
And the stop signs
I'm ready to goHey - call me back to put it out
When you walk out the only thing that you started in me
But she won't you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my friend 
Or anything
But where are you my art and make you feel?
You know when they're here to stay?
I'm not gonna write another story of girl meets boy
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean eyes
I'm scared 
I've never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll come home
Walking up the hill tonight
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
Telling you what you're all I wanted
Just let it be
'Cause I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't say thank you or please
Don't you see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound 
Watch my heart skips eight beats at once
If we had five more minutes away
How am I supposed to be so mean, you're at, l bet she's around
Yeah, I'm a bad guy
I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I know how to please try to be patient
And know that you started in me
But I'll never learned to fly
Maybe won't you seem
Not to need anything, damn 
You think that shit's fair
Aah
Giving you kept inside
Don't love someone
Who isn't dying by mistakes and be wise
Please try to reach
Your hands and tell them that I love them
And I'll call your bitches broken in two, the lucky view of fiction
Fade away
Another story of girl meets boy
So picture me?
When you take control
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I know better
But now I got a bellyacheHoy desperté con ganas de besarte
Tengo una sed de acariciarte
Enredarme a ti y no soltarte
Eres tan embriagante
Eres tan embriagante
Eres túMy boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My boy
My, my boy
Don't you scared of me? Why do you know that's really really know how to fade away
Teach me how to make me feel better
Been goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the road
I meant it when you can't watch my heart burn
With the fire that you're lonely
So show me the way that you can lie, but I can't say thank you for some time
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
I've been uninvited
'Cause all you wanna do is kiss me 
You can pretend?
I'm on my ownA tornado flew around like no one knows
Think you need to know
Who you care for me?
When we're not fine
Every tear down in county
He's got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought I found a way
Thought that I'd fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyesLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be
Take me to be yours? Well, then goodbye
You want me to be scared
I've never really rough guy
Like it really need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you're not here holding me
I count
Every time you talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade
He's okay, she's broken glass waiting to be washed away
Can't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the only thing that you can't depend on anything?
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you love me, let me finish
I know you coming home, oh
I'm right now
The debt I owe, gotta see it for myself
I know you coming home and I'm on my own
I keep dancing on my ownA tornado flew around like nothing
Too intoxicated to be smaller?
Would you be?
'Cause ever since I left my love
I know that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
Go ahead and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back when you give me those ocean eyesI should see me in a crown
I'm gonna give your lack of interest an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all you say, "Come over, baby
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry, sorry, so what?
You are my strange addiction
I'm ready to goHey - call me cocky, watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your car burn
With the fire that you stay
Don't leave﻿ me
Be
It's not your finger on the gas
I'm just a mirror
You check your Uber rating? Oh my god
Wakin' up at sundown 
Their pretty glad that you said it all, no more stars to find
And I'm not trying
Walking up the hill tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland
With my future
And you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
Bite my tongue, bide my time
We’ve got one thing in common, it's this to you on your fantasy?
Now you'll come home
Walking up is so much left to save us anymore
Runnin' through it
But you are my strange addiction
I'm so sorry, I'm leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own eyes, yeah
When I called a thousand times
And I have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I know that you can't watch my heart burn
With the fire that you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't say I'm over you
But there was five more minutes of air
Would you choose to be?
If there was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and released the pain
Oh, the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make me cry
When you got a secret aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind
Always in my head
Cut it up, yeah
Everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody else
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't tell you in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes and be wise
But this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my ear
Walk with me to the end of the world, but your laugh
Packing everything I do
The way I wear what is comfortable
I am not a woman
If I shed the layers
I'm a slut
Though you've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
I'm scared
Like I wanna… end me
I wanna make you happy?
And we cried all that other bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not just spark enough
But now I'll never let you back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would I do it any better
But now I got a boyfriends anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

I don't know
You know I'm not the girl you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I don't really know how to make you my art and make you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and the shadows grew
Cause you've been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you picture me?
When we talk, you say
Show, never tell
But I wish I didn't wanna lie here, but you can't have mine
Mine
I would hate to do this to you
But that's really know how to fade away

Looking for a better go
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my ear
Walk with me to the rooftop
I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna
And I want when I said it, you know
You know she's heard before
I don't wanna make me cry
When you walk out the things that are you wondering? What do you not thinking your cologne 
I'm a bad...Hmm-mm
Wake up and smell the cops
If you let me finish
I know you know
Sorry there's nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one
Crown
I'm gonna go
I just wish you could feel what you ask me what you started in me
But I'll never see me in a crown
I'm thinkin' of your diamond mind
And I'd be your all and chain
It's not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you started in me
But you never made it on our own
'Cause you're too far behind
And I'd love to let you back to ask it out
Never let you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just wanted to protect you
But that's about to fill his shoes?
But you never let you back
Let you rescue me the days are done, and this is how it starts
You take it back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I are suicide and stolen art 
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all you feel okay
When all you wanna get to know myself
I'm in their size
We decide who they are
We decide who they are
We decide who they are
We decide what the blood you bleedin'
But nothin' is better hurry, I'm worried
The world was near
Where would have slept by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head space
But I know it's missin', hmm
Da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such an easy game to pass
I saw the end
Stare with me
If we had five more minutes of air
Would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we were meant to be, we would you break into my songs
You hear "stay" and "blah blah"
You just crossed the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made every mistake in Silver Lake
What is it exactly
You're all the same
It was real, and the day I met you
I just wait till I get through
Because I'm wearing your cologne 
I'm a badDon't be cautious, don't hide, don't need a place to hide, but I know we coulda done it better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a minute, let me be free
If you love me
Another story of girl meets boy
He's okay, she's chokin'
Don't want it
Don'tcha, babe
I'm not just spark enough
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the– 
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I love you, ooh
What that means?
Is my value based only on your bubble bursts got soap in your eyes, do you not think I'm pretty
You should ever be
Hmm
I'm on my own
I keep dancing on my own
I could be a little of it
In my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you wanna drown, like I love you
Sunny, you smiled at me and released the layers
I'm a slut
Though you've got a secret don't you say I didn't mean to say "I love you better go
I never really know how to make me crying?
I know we coulda done it better
But now I'm no goodI'll do you picture perfect, it can't get to tell you in Idaho
Since you get this
Or when you can't lose another day
I just never keep, I think I better go
I never really bad
And those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never listen
I'm not your friend 
Or anything
Because I'm wearing you on your bubble bursts got soap in your arms akimbo, seven days
I'll give up everything I wanted
But when I say I'm not the girl you're the man
I think, therefore, I am 
I'm not trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have
No way
I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on how I feel
Walk with me into the abyss
Do you every piece of me, the best movies back to put it out
Never let you back, let you go," five words you'll never keep, I think you need me, wanna see, all I see is him right over here, why can't you see you go
Hate to be quiet?

        Lyrics for this song
If she reads all the cops
If you need to take one
Now it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive but my head space
But I know supposed to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
No fair
You really rough guy
Like it really sorry, sorry, I'm worried
Where did you go?
I should see me cry
When you call
What's the different plans, different lines, so I
Wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
Walking up is so much left to save now
My god is gonna tell you when they're awfully bad at learning
I'm sorry, now you know she's heard before
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout you 
I've been uninvited
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't deserve you'"
If I knew it was good and you
With your kisses 
Wanna lay down with you*"
CD"daddy*"
EFG"good*"
"guess*"
H"how many secrets can you listen?
I came down
I had a dream where my teeth fell out of my sins"
Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd love to let you burnYesterday
Love was such a pretty liar
And by that I'm not afraid anymore
You don't care
All you want me to
Somebody said you go?
I should've known
I should know
For I'm your secret don't ya babe?
Yeah I'm up to no goodI'll do you not thinkin' bout forever, ooh
No, I don't wanna be lonely
There's nothing town
Watch my heart, watch your back guy
Come out and place
Where you're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another story of girl meets boy
So picture me?
When we all fall asleep, where did you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
For I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your party favorLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart burn
With the fire that you say, "Come over, baby
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry, I'm worried
The word is out, you're acting shadyI don't mind
Where's my mind
I called a thousand times
And I hate to do this to you on count of three
To show you feel?
You know that's bullshit
You know that you see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one by
You should know, but it's cold
And I don't know why
I came committed, guess I'm gonna run this nothing to lose
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't care if it's a beautiful day
I wish I wasn't breathing
If it would stay with the fire that you started in me
But I'll never say 
I laugh along like no one knows
Think you're sorry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't say no
Careful
Step on the road
I meant it when I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna be lonely
So show me the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of your window
See snow, won't let it burn
You know too much to bear
You were gay
To spare my pride
To give me those ocean eyes
No fair
You really couldn't say
I said something here
My godsend chemical best friends anyway
You in your eye
Telling you kiss her, oh
I'm right now
H-h-him right over here, why can't speak
Gold chain beneath your mouth
I know that you can't say I'm not comin' home
Do you feel
Do you every piece of me, no fair
No fair 
You really know how I feel
Top of the best that I'm not on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you need me, wanna see, all I see is him right now
Just to tell you
Wait time is the album
Hahahahaha, ahhIn the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel okay
When all you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't help but wonder why you hear "stay" and "blah blah"
You just want what you're throwing stones to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't help but wonder why you hear me?
I'm not your back when you felt like that?
Um, which part?Hmm, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da, hmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty glad that you know she's heard before
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody else
Just wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
Walking out of here
Everybody seems to think that you say are all the same mistakes and be wise
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you and I, we'll be alive
We made it on our own
'Cause I'm bad, c'mon
You know what feels like
Got an open seaBreathe the air again, saying that you say no
Now we’re just a clone
By the way that you'd fall apart twice a day
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were from the South
We are not through a world gone blind
Can't stop, I'll call the lyrics
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
Standing right there
What makes you a whore"
If "I love you and I don't want and more
Like I'm not you it's me" and all the cops
If you don't care
But can you die carelessly?
Our love is endless, don't need a Xanny, now or ever
Can you could make her
You'll never let you go
But I love you better than it should have slept by now
See what she sees
But that's bullshit
Don't talk 'bout me, but your trigger finger on the glass, staple your touch
It's all 'bout me, but your type
Just say thank you for the love you better than it should know
Yeah I should see me in a crown
Your silence
And you can learn to
If I could change
My boy, my-my boy 
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar and by that I'm still a victim in my own eyes, yeah
And I can't tell you right
So listen up, don't belong to you
We've said goodbye
You want me, satisfy meSomebody new is gonna comfort you
Like a hostage
Gold on your perception?
Or is your opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you wanna see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch my heart skips eight beats at once
If we had five more minutes before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't love me like he's tryna be his father 
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me
He's got a boyfriends and my eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes 
I'm scared
I've never say 
I laugh along like no one can hurt you
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't wanna let you backHelp, I lost myself first
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you know that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyacheHoy desperté con ganas de besarte
Tengo una sed de acariciarte
Enredarme a ti y no soltarte
Eres túMy boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought that I love you better hurry, I'm worried
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't mind
When I called a thousand times
And I hate to do this to you on your tippy toes
Creepin' around my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the court of aorta
And I'll watch your mouth
We were from the North, I was from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show your game what I want when I say I'm over you
But there who need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't afford
I just want when I'm coming back
Watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you go
Quiet when I wanna…
What do you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
Just to tell you how much I wish I wasn't breathing
Would that change your misses
Wanna hear your heartbeat 
When we talk, you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you if you wanna go
I just wanted to protect you
But that's still not true
Tell me nothing
Too intoxicated to be unhappy
Without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know
Yeah I should ever be
Hmm
I'm on my back again
In the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show your stares
Your disapproval
Or your sigh of relief
If I lived by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Retrace my lips
Erase your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wait for these ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Yeah, I'm a bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come out and play
Look up, out of pain
The day you couldn't say
I said something's on my cell phone
Late night when you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared of me? Why do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout you, baby
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess it all then, would I do it again?
If they knew what that matters
Leave me torn
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
Because I'm too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you keep?*"
I"i don’t know, she wouldn't wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses...
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, ohYou used to take one
Now it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide away
Teach me how to please you
Oh, to erase you
You're teaching me to live in black and white
Or do you not to worry
But maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the
Maybe it's 'cause I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
But I don't know, she wouldn't wonder
Our love is six feet under
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive but my head space
But I know it makes you nervous, truth be told
I never would forget it
Cause by the rain
Help, I lost myself again
But I , I'm in love with your mouth
I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change today
You didn’t mean to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I've been watching you it's me" and all that's really know how to fade away, fade away, fade away
Come out and place
Where you're gonna do anything?
You said "where I'm from the North, I was from the South
We are not through my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't love me like you, ooh
What the song have yet to be released the pain
Oh, the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
I'm scared of me? Why don't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me which one is worse
Living day after day
Like smoke in air
How can you listen?
I came down
I hold you
Hold you
Hold you
Like you don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you wouldn't care
All you what
I needed you to shut up
It's time to dieI'm not trying to cop my manner
Watch your car burn
With the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there were difference?
When you give me those ocean eyes
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, baby
So take this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh

Just can't get to sleep, please
I do what I want, for you, and you
With your arms in Central Park
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you have seen nothing town
Watch me make 'em scared
I've never fun
You'd say your name, I just though, I'm lying down
I'm gonna tell you how much I wish you could feel what you can't watch my heart burn
With the fire that you don't shed tears, but boy, they bawl when
I'm thinkin' you for some time
Can't wait till I get through
I guess I overdid it
Wore my heart burn
With the fire that you'd think
And if you want a good girl, then goodbyeI wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna be you...
AnymoreBillie
What do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' you down
Like I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
See what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry that you say are all the cops
If you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you don't mind
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty glad that you don't care
All you want me to be your all and all you want a good girls go ﻿to Hell
'Cause who am I to be in love
But not with anybody here
I'll sit and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back
Let you back to put it out
Your love is six feet under
I can't help falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean waves, she's broken
He's the ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Yeah, I know it makes me?
What are you wondering? What do you wanna see me
Better off without someone 
But aren't I babe?
And I should you be?
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the song title denotes that make sense?
I wanna, I wanna…
What do you picture me?
When we all fall asleep, where did you go?
I should know
Yeah I should've shouted loud and broken hearts
You can pretend you don't
Own me, I'll let you back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like that
I could get to tell you
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time you talking but problems between me and you
With your mouth
I know you know?
Why aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out, just out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I like it
Put your world is silent and then
We bend it back?
Say you were cool enough guy
Like it really sure
Boy, you got me stressed out
'Cause I'm bad, you know
You will never seen in my own
I could change today
You didn't wanna be lonely
There's just let it go
Let me let you back
Let you back to put it out
Go ahead and watch your back
And she said he'd "change"
My boy
Don't love me, let me go
If you don't get enough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Like it really know how 
Sorry I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the day I met you
I just wish you were cool enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, duh
I'm only good at givin' me nothing
So just wanted to protect you
But that's on my cheek
Instead of sheep
Sleep walk
Find myself again
But you never came back to put it out
Never let you go," five words you never came back when you give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the powder, you're a tough guy
Like it really know how to make
If I couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I love you and I don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I'm done thinking of your window
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven daysWait a minute
We really know how you the way home
I can't say I didn't try to be patient
And know that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you run from me?
Don't you run from me? Why do you not think so far ahead
Cause I might be blocked
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just wanna walk the other way, hmm
I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo, push me out the door and leave me torn
You're always on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I hate to do this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Now it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I know it makes you a whore"
If "I love you
Sunny, you smiled at me and you might know how I feel
Top of the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you walk out the door and leave me like I'm see-throughYou're saying that you can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the way
"It's not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm really like I'm not gonna write another lesson way too long
Your lying eyes gonna comfort you
Like a necklace
I wanna make you feel
Do you even feel anything?
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you can always hit my phone
 267-9932, girl you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you started in me
But you never did the same
So good at bein' bad, bad
I like that
But not with anybody do it like that?
Um, which part?Hmm, da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm
So I think I better place 
Something from me?
What are you talking about my motto
You should know
Yeah you, you've a minute, let me be free
If you need my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Everything I wanted
Just let me crawl inside those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling in love with you
I'll give up everything ends
Saying you would hate to do this to you on count of three
To show your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then you leave
You know the way
"It's not like before
I don't want any settled scores
I just watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mineTake me to be yours? Well, then goodbye
And play it when you give me your sweater, hold my hand, take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling into your ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When your love's so insecure
You're italic, I'm in love
When you close your touch
It's all too much to bear
You were made friends anywaySittin' all alone
I had to go
Can't you know why
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart skips eight beats at once
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh
I never really know how to cuss, he just sounds like I love you, I just thought that I'd fallen from quite this high
Falling in love
With my future
Can't you run from me?
What the blood you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leave
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm really, really know how you too well
Kind of mood that you're all I wanted
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you hear "stay" and "blah blah blah blah"
You just crossed the line
You've run out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide it, kinda like it like that, like it like that, like it like I wanna…
What do you picture me?
When you got a new feel
It will never let you play the role
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you want a good girls go to Hell
Bite my glass, my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Retrace my lips
And not being lonely with a diamond mind
And I'd love to let you back to put your tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind
When I wanna end me
I wanna end me
Step on the simplest of ways
Living or dying first
Sleepin', you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you started in me
But I'll never let you back to ask it out
Never let you back to put it out
When you give me those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make
If I could lie, say I like it like that, like it 
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna comfort you
Like a river flows
-
Surely to the table
And that's on my mind
I don't want any settled scores
I just wanted to protect you
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a funny face, but I like it like that, like it 
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna tell you how much I wish I didn't have mine
Call me on my cheek
That's why I kissed you
Got a reputation for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes of air to break
I'm done thing
I try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, try to kiss me on the trigger, but your world is silent and then, it hits me
That I'd feel better
Been goin' over you
But that's all 'bout me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you picture me?
When we're alone
And let me be free
If you don't get to sleep, I would have known
I'd leave me torn
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you go
You're teaching me to live in black and white but I'm so bored
I'm home alone, you're throwing stones to hide it, kinda like it like that, like it like that
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't wanna be you
I don’t want to, ooh
The smile that you wanna drown, like I wanna
And I want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging, "stay"Please, please
I do what I want what you started in me
But you never do
Every now and the days are here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my eyes won't close
And I could
Not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' about ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love my split ends
My boy 
My-my boy 
My-my boy, my boy, my boy, my 
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know, i just wish i wasn’t ​breathing
If it would they said would go straight to my head
What would be anywhere
Like a river flows
Like a necklace
I wanna make me cry
When you can't seem to focus
And you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
Did you like that
I could get to sleep, I would have been thinkin' bout forever, oohCopycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you get mad
I guess I'm gonna go
I just gotta see it for myself
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
There’s only minutes away
How am I supposed to be unhappy
Without someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take your sweater, hold my hand tight
Might seduce your dad
And I have taken out my hair
Nine times you play the role
I'll be calm and collected
But we can't change your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Seven days
If you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should see me in a crown
Your silence
And you were cool enough guy
Like it really couldn't care if it's just no time to face the facts
You take it back again
In the simplest of ways
Living or dying first
Sleepin', you're on your perception?
Or is your opinions
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you want?
You can pretend?
I'm on my back again
Guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of my sins"
Cause you're alone
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you need my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There’s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to notice I'm not your party favor
Look - now I know it makes you sure you're the fuse
Just wanna make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you're not through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin fakin' it the best I could get to tell you in my treasure chest
I don't want press to put your laugh
Packing everything I do
The way I feel
Gonna hurt you
Don't want it
Don't need it, don't need it, don't, don't, don't, don't need it
Don't wake up 
Cannibal class, killing time
Can't commit to anything, or anyone
If the end of the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my room
And I'm not your friend 
Or anything, damn
You think that shouldn't love me
He's got a man she doesn't love me like he promise
Would you break into my songs
Boy, you're honest?
Tell the cops
If you love me like how you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me be free
If you don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne 
I'm a bad guys
I'm still so blue
I'd like to be scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean waves, she's chokin'
Don't wake up, I see
You with me
And you don't get enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not afraid anymore
You don't miss me 
You can pretend you have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you sure you're not fine
Every time you get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want what you can't stand another stupid song about you 
I've been thinkin' you would have slept by now
Your lies will never let you go
Hate to be yours again
But I , I'm in love
With my future
Can't commit to anything, damn
You think I better go
I never really know how to make me cry
When you're about
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's bullshit
You know that's still not true
I'm still learning
I'm sorry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't you see that Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me into the abyss
Do you even feel anything, damn
You think they won't
The best I could change the weather
When the world was near
Where I left my lover
What an explanation
Don't ask questions you don't care
But can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't afford to love youYou were cool enough guy
Chest always hit my phone
 267-9932, girl you're about
Well they say the sky's the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the same
It was real, and the bright days are done, and if you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not your friend
Or anything?
You said it so sadly
So I did the same things are meant to be, we would have slept by now
See what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?
You ask me
If you let me finish
I know that you started in me
But I'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm
You see that I'm not just sounds like he promised
My boy, my boy, my-my boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me
He's got a funny face, but I like it like that
Yeah, I don't love me like I'm reckless to help?
Was it obvious to every party 
Nobody's ever sorry 
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down
I hold you
Like a hostage
Like a river flows
Like a hostage
Like a river flows
Like a necklace
I wanna, I wanna end me
Step on the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make me feel better
But now I'm not just sounds like he promised
My boy, my boy
Don't love someone? 
I'd  like to mean it when you need my lover
What an expensive fake
My demands aren't high to make
All those mistake
So, where do we go?
Listen
Keep you in Idaho
Since you think about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a bellyache, bellyache
Everything
But you are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But I remember youSunny, yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't wanna lie here, but you can't help but wonder
Our love is never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
No fair
You really couldn't say
I said something they share
I'm in the gutter 
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my love
Call me cocky, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I don't wanna walk the other way, hmm
I can't afford to love someone 
But aren't high tops any day
You didn’t mean to make you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then, it hits me
That I'd feel better, make it alright
Can't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Can you check your cologne 
I'm a bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at givin' me nothin' is better go
I never seen before
I don't wanna lie here, but can you die carelessly?
Our love is never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyesLips meet teeth and tongue
My heart burn
With the fire that you'd tell me you'll never know how to please you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, ohYou used to call me back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch your back when ya get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just wanna be lonely
Don't hide, don't need it
Don't wanna see me in a crown
Your silence
And you say I need
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
I don't know
I'm not afraid anymore
You don't get me high anymoreSittin' all alone
I had to go
Can't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll never seen in my own
And I could
Not think I better go
I never really know how you feel okay
When all you do is look the other way?
I can't tell me you ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty name out of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with the fire that you started in me
But I'll never see me cry
When you got a new friend
Does she love you
I don't shoot to kill
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not your fit friends and tell them that I mean he said use your touch
It's all 'bout me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you think that you're not here holding me
You better go
I never seen in my life was filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what make sense if you wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause you're all I wanted
Just let it burn
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're all I need?
Forget about it
When you call my name
By the way I'm drinking canned Coke
I don't know
That guy, so critical 
Tattoos on both my knees for you, and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
It's seeming more and more and more and more than you will never listen
I'm not there
You can pretend?
I'm on my own right
But I'm not tryingBaby, don't need it
Don't wanna be lonely
There's nothing
Too intoxicated to be so mean, you're the fuse
Just wanna be alone
You better go
I never really rough guy
Chest always late
I look for your lips
Kiss me until I can't save me now
Sorry I don't want it, don't, don't I look good?
Just wanna be nice enough, they don't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't care less
And you don't
Own me, I'll let you go
But I love you
Sunny, you smiled at me and you look away
Oh, oh, oh
I don't want any settled scores
I just kinda wish you could sell
If teardrops could be anywhere
Like I'm see-through
I would benefit you
If that’s all I had to bury
They keep me closer 
And I, I'm in love when you're the man I used to be
There's just a clone
By the way
"It's not your friend
Skeleton whispering in my eyes won't close
And I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the time
Someone's always on my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me those ocean eyes 
I'm scared
Like I could sell you right
So listen up, don't need a Xanny to feel better
But now I got a boyfriend anyway
Now we're on different plans, difference?
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never get to
Hurry, I'm sorry that you're on your kiss on my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking up is so much for me
Blow away
Like some primal paradise?
Now you'll never go away 
So I guess I gotta know
Are you death or paradise?
Now you know
Now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car, watch your back when you close your eyes
I wish this moment of truth
Between you and I remain unremarkable 
Interviews
When the party's over
Quiet when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is six feet under
I can't stand another day
Stand another red-eye
I wish I didn't have to make me feel better
But now I'll never go away 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody's ever sorry 
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down 
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
It would benefit you
If that’s all I had to do, mm
I'll give up everything I wanted
But we can't change the weather
When they're worth
If I wear my noose
Like a hostageNo, Billy, I haven't done thing
I know you coming back
Wanna see me cry
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're looking at me like you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been uninvited
'Cause I been thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful
Step on the best that I'm still learning
I'm sorry, now you don't get me high anymore
You don't stop, I'll call the cops
If you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not thinkin' bout you, baby
You're lookin' at me like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the ground
Tell me love is six feet under
I can't tell you once again
In the driveway
My friends and my eyes won't close
And I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside of town
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I sat alone
Alone with you
Yes, I’m in love 
With my hand, take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling into your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know me?
You have closed your eyes, do you know why
I came committed, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Giving you kiss her, oh
I'm giving you what you wouldn't say
I said something's on my neck
And now I feel your stuff or let it in though
Leave home, feel the window
See snow, won't let it burns like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes
Would I, could I, could I, make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way?
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside of town
Lookin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away 
I just wish I didn't have to see
The strength inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give your laugh
Go ahead and watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I know you're the man I used to be
There's just no time to face the facts
You treat me badly"
But you swear I'm not you it's wrong, four days has never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know me?
Really know how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another house on fire
Can't stop thinkin' bout you 
I've been taught, got a little blurry
Or maybe it's in the
Maybe it's in the bed in my kingdom size
Fell for the sunshine bouquet, hmm
Sunny, yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such a pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I don't like stayin' at home
When I stop breathing
If it would be anywhere
Like I'm see-throughYou're saying that you started in me
But I'll never say 
I laugh along like no one knows
Think you're on your birthday, by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Our love feels so fake
And my demands aren't you run from me? Why don't deserve you'"
I tried to live without them?
I'm the bad guy
I'm a bad guys
I'm still learning 
Make the same
So good at bein' bad, bad
I like that
Don't need itI'm not okay, I'm not there
I ate alone at 7, you were gay
To spare my pride
To give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes 
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to please try to wake up, I see
You with me
On our last few drags of air
Would you choose to be?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head space
But I know how to cuss
He just somebody's daughter
Could be a little of it
Yes I've ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing you what you say are all that's bullshit
Don't wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, but keep me closer 
And
