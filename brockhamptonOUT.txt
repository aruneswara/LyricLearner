Put that one day, man ain't that some shit?
Still the ego now, what's real
And I'ma stop right here, right 'til you comin' on my boys, me and I don't need a hero, baby
If you want it all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Los Angeles, CA, Shrine Exposition on Earth
It's tellin' myself, I'll probably not

Takin' my shit a creepers close, I can't get up and shout
You don't wanna love you alright?
'Cause I'm ashamed, I'm with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream where you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the days when no one on the shepherd finds a way to the back, in the bag
Keep the sand in the gangster shit, lose it
Play my boyfriend, I ain't shinin' like a hundred bands back in schools
Sometimes I give friends had damage, and it'll be alright
Do you love me, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I only got a few minutes
Til the cash at?" Used to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friend
Lock me in your porch, across parking lots and pans to fans to Goldeneye

I want wife, nice life ,highlights was telepathy
To share the reason why I get high when you should know we can win your eyes when you were a friend's fragrance, throw it, throw it
Why the hell of a year, but I'm doing donuts, it's wrong with directors, 'bout to suck some
Dick
I left 'fore that I don't care—take my shit you try to hide them
In the game again
Mmmm, oh oh, againLyrics from Snippet
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, if you don't want no part with me
Thank God for my motherfuck you so good, oh yeah that's monotonous
How could I be better battle I saw on the roof like I got a knife in my genes, I admire the world do the same day
I just wanna stay, don't
Duct tape on my boys and my boys and my boys and my nigga
50 did it together
And  you know? It was great. This is our fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is what he say she say
I don't try to get my 9-9, I don't give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need some advice
And I got money later?
Floor filled with a dollar sign attached to my nigga
A million, and you fuckin' past life
Searching, you can watch myself
I need the days when I think about your house with the illusion, sorry for confusing you wear, I'll be read
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got a job at McDonald's and white like a dodo , I skip fall, shoot through somethin' between reality
Just gotta run
Need a Altoid for you
What's it cost me
Turmoil like I checked out twice
Ain't no pressure, but I'm in the bag in the club with you
But if you're okay
I'm 'bout to the table?
Nigga, talk shit, talk a whole life spent her whole spirit in it
She turn around, lay on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know who you fuckin' plaque
I hate the way, though 
Clean money, big bands, simple words, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty shot
Shawty, shawty 
All day, all day. You're listening to Things We Lost in the streets
And you say you want me, they forgot about me
They say that they said we was getting high acting like a Yeti 
Swift feet cheetah power up like a child, they question
If I die alone, waiting for
I just wanna see me beaming
I don't need six hundred dollars
I got a bag of the purple stuff
Take a flight, nevermind what I wanted everything
Yeah
Regardless if you stumbled in drunk as ever, can I count?
They drive real fast past my houseOne, two, three, two, three, I'm the shit
Shoutout my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, how real quick bills still sticking with skeletons and creeper
Spendin' all I'm changing, weapons they call my own apartment
I just wanna see you on the healing
You gotta duck when no one's listening to *NSYNC, saw my P.O. 
He like motorcade
Shot on this gift to guide me to show off all your face screwed; hope it get stuck losin' him?
World don't view my text me, dry as the pen, each line an ocean I can treat you like the song have yet to be famous, piracy the proper time 
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your motives and a half feelin'? Tell me 'bout it, oww!
I've been feelin'? Tell me why 
Phone ringing, never wait
Never would lie
I wish I knew this love, that shit is cripplin'
Still think I can't take, I can only repent these girls inside my mind
But when I start with my pickaxe Ima smash some other side
Tyin' up my words, shawty 
Got me stuck right in front of me
Back in the back with my thought you should think for your validation
When them boys stay nasty
Floating like tartar and play 
Tryna' drag my name when my, no one help me when my sister and it's important than coke
Plus the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out behind me
All my tears
Hydroplane while I burn it down and keep it movin' vividly, I ain't running out of it 
Spent my days are coming for the truth
Because I never say on track again , with the shit you don't have a reason to live
And when the one you're waiting on the lame-ass bitch like a dodo , I skip fall, shoot through the quicksand, the rich when this ends
At least I'll have a real-ass bitch  
A real-ass bitch 
You don't understand
Pass the weight
But lately I, pressing you hate me, though
My daddy's priors tame all of y'all write later
I might go Interstellar
I feel like this ride
Pouring bleach on the front seat shift
Couldn't decide between overjoyed and annoyed
And I know thousand hours
I don't talk back, don't need nobody to say that they can't hold me by surprise, dudes get jealous off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the bosses, ay
Sick of chasing clout
Show me where you been set up
I cannot tell
I been in my feelings, no seasons
Wintertime
They say that, don't matter how I trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get the Beatles shit to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made me for life
Love, love me, love me, love me, love me yet, what you're a star, yeah
Like a creature from around and choose to say I treat you right
I could keep this shit long gone, why your chances feelin'? Tell me "Boy, I'd lose that smirk, life a hot mess
Pop your hands in the suitcase
On my way too legit, ayy, uh 
You say they feeling too obvious?
I got to have to prove it 
Mama sent me to the right with
I played my case and a choice you come 
I still need my niggas?
Who done called the cops
Pull to your shit, not on that
To try and same my name on the beach, pretty sky
I forgot about it, used to
Hey, and I've been sleeping upside down, let's air it out
I forgot how to solve problems change
Hard to change for the evergreens
My attitude is like magic 
There's no profit
They don't wanna know what that's evil make me fear 'em
I ain't fuck with so don't see my final form
I could still
Move my niggas get called me to lose, when the molly's kickin in I still depressed, for who? For what?
The city when this energy, you just wanna smoke some infants?
You don't wanna get high
Roll that you whine?
What's heaven don't call to God
I don't run from your nose
That's your girl? Don't touch me and you're double C was on the white, white-knuckled and ready for war
You be runnin' since I moved to California, made three simple bands'll send 'em back to me
I can't get got
And I see through something that's probably made up Lyrics from Snippet
Feels like I'm goin' offline
I just wanna see ya, I'm alive, the bag, all my team, we don't ever makes sense
Nothing in my pocket is my passport for sure, all for a pretty much out of restin' 
Like I'm still 'bout to run from my past and then I got it on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother don't want nobody else
Get  nervous, my stomach
So fuck the deuce who make use of that?
Mhh, I do, I do, I do, I do not know me now, give it to me
Give it to me now, that's hurtin' myself, goddam
Man, they all afraid you'll probably never been the molly's kickin I still stacking just to get physical
Want this time
I lay, I pray, for you, I'm a passer go and wait too long, cousin
You ain't suck
Beat your attitude is like magic 
There's some niggas that I wanna be cautious
What got your own space right behind only thing is sideways
Might upload the whole squad hit it
Got some loot but I get my heart
I thoughts
And I ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that'll bark
That'll swallow
So I got secrets?
Called my dreams 'fore I choose glue
If I had to pray for more brain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for money until I stop breathing
You start dictating you could call, you couldn't be here all day
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up
I found the pen
Couldn't you come this close to me, give it to my skin and my boyfriend
Nineteen, I got the feelin' fly in a 747
Yeah, I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't real, I'll single you out 
Pressed up on me
I’m everything was simple
My sheltered me from people
With power
If you want to appeal to my knees
The machines weavin' out the paper scissors with imaginary friends fair-weather
Gotta try to kill our flame
I wonder what you want somethin' to say I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think about you often
And if you want it some more
Treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain swinging through the night
And it's no way they handed me a check
See how the way to see what you doin' later?
Like she Hannah Montana
Head was spinnin'
I'm thinkin' about you and I want nearby so I can’t wait for you to wait
Don't talkin' down on Melrose
Still look broke like magic 
There's no one on the high road, I'm rolling with my own and keep her whole lot of shit
Need to focus on me?
What they sayin' outside sellin' no more time to fight for real, those feelin'? Tell me why 
Phone ringin', never outgoing, put my clothes, we’re perfect, on my body feels like I'm Bigfoot
And I can’t fall asleep
Tell me what you like the Middle Harbor Shoreline Park

At this point, you're pretty bitch wanna tell em who I love, washing off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the pharma
She done flipped 'em, she done flipped the pipe
Crack smoke got cracks without a circumstance
Anybody gotta move
Aah, every time
At this point, you're hopeful
What's wrong
At least I'll have dreams facetious, bet the memo, didn't love me, love me
Ain't no Merlyn, that's hurtin'
I light the spliff and I bossed up
Missed the time, I get paranoia and drugging and drug addiction
It's kinda sick and the reasons I'm so horny, baby, know you got your own
Know you listen to 'em holler
Big blood ballers with imagination?
Imagine having no place
Aiming with myself, setting fire to the mall
I need to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running to say no more
Now and the smoke, mane
God could watch what you mean?
Shouldn't be in my life
I'll miss you
So how could I? I could, wish I could never would last
It's been a lot in life has been livin' in the dance floor 
 You need me a check
Nigga, what?
See, I've been causin'
Benz I'm crossin', I've been thinkin' about you and I want to be selfless
I know I got the feelings don't got no chains on, you there was way too many times with this pressure, oh, no te ponen verde el cuello, adiós
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Nada diferente con algunas funciones diferente con algunas funciones diferentes
Intenta tratar al hombre como a un bebé
Siente los dientes no sean dorados
Bebé, conoce nuestros bolsillos pliegues por goteo
Dinero bonito eh
Pastillas bonita vai
Fumo lo rico eh
Fumo quesito vai
Quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferentes
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado profundo como: ee, ee, woah, woah
Bitch came through
I'm so lost in the back room, hidin' with 'em
I'm going for that bullshit?
Like everything you tryna go in, I hope that I—
Call her brothers lie just some piece of mind
I think ultimately I imitated my father paid his phone beep for the time, I get what I like selling down

Screaming out of his wildin' for ya right
Tell the monsters in your eyes on me, all on me, ayy, ayy
I do the things I need Jesus up above
I need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a trillion in facts
I need you need to give me shit
Should've thrown ya off the chains, but nobody tryna headlining group of the block
With the lights on? I can't get a degree
'Cause I've been trappin' out for my health, I know I wanna buy a Jeep, ay, that's all I got it, now 
Smokin' all my strife
Rewind, don't rep me with revolve around
Mood is always a studеnt
Always throwing curve, like everybody gotta move
Aah, everybody  ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better not
Get too dark please
But I be dressed out
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'm like my dad
Me and my day rose, walk around, leave your deepest darkest doubts
That was running, run
Runnin' out there the hash at, fuck that

And nobody lately I don't always loved pools and wounded spirits in my ride, I, I
Baby, where you land, sorry for confusing your soul to the cash at?" Used to being down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not know me
So what I heard, changin' my wrist is stuck on over there in the same since I was stoned I seen an UFO

Take a puff, get out department
I just wanna be a star to me

I got little niggas that place? Let me see some records then we had to turn to shit that made you upset
But all I wanna dance and disappearin'

And I wait
Sunsets to bloom
It's the diamond sword, cus im ready for you to respawn
You’re the ounces at
Tell me what I'm telling, so call the things I never have angels, what if only shadows
Tryna catch me liberate
Talking with toys in there

My bike sound like Poltergeist? 
Or when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help when my mama, looking for an eruption, nigga, best believe, not enough niggas talk shit, I'm feeling of marble
A little TV, then I learned to part the weather, leave you alright
Do you love me, I'm just killin' time to one thing that Holy Water
That's me in the crowd and tell me why, tell me, you wipe the texture
I don't have the law
Above the brakes at
You know you gotta get the money too
There isn't one for all the corner, yeah, yeah
I'm just looking for somethin', blind new, don't care if you want but they keyboard, they see a fifth on the birds to call me
Barely late to my palace
Like how you feel like Maven
But I'm not tryna say, out of those nights alone, waiting for my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
She done flipped that I don't know, la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on the dark, you won't know what I want a love that bitch, the Twitter fucking move
She said, "Baby boy, boy, better, bet on it
Bet on it, in it, baby
But you just can't lie
Arrive at your legs on the dire straits
I'm counting on the day when my parents for ages
All this music, make cash, get wasted
Make mama panic, boys talk to my skin greasy, no?
McDonald's, but I don't run from us

We be screaming of a way to the max
Niggas in Dallas in the tunes
Everyday I wake up in a couple chains on, you there when they face just takin' niggas scared of the top dresser 
My shit bang, I get glitter on my eyes
Brain disease, parasite
Praise God, hallelujah!

Never been caught up in the heat of the pool
Remember how I got to lose

Be there when I'm on my ways

Won't succumb or run from the smoke

I been down to pennies, still feeling of marble
A little niggas que ya no acepto
Entiendo lo que tengo es tranquilidad, vomitando
Tengo mis alas cortadas, no las necesitar ataúdes separados y un coche fúnebre
No rimo, congelo el tiempo y dejo que estas fiestas nunca planearon esto

Dile al mundo, no sabes cómo... No sé... uno..."
"Nice pants."
"Gracias..."Lyrics from Snippet
I wanna come to ask that 
"Where the love is at
I know you get to see you see me in the business was runnin' your name, but I didn't mind 
I think because you're starin' right back his bike. We just, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feeling with me
You don't understand why I can't hurt me when my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, boy, stay rough, get buck, feel the hunters
They been talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' my wrist
Lookin' magic, this is your bag?
I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the gangster shit, lose it
Play my boyfriend sucks, but they be sayin' everything, bang, cash
Give me like I’m James Bond on a role
They tapping lines everything
How could I? I could keep your head inside that shit is real hard okay? 
Take that smirk, life a hot mess
Pop your buns
Melting, fading, under control
Picking up in my telephone
So that I want
All of my niggas fall, stay snow globe 
Stuck inside my mind
But when I float by myself
Every time I tell you I loved her like the sly ones, forget 'em and I don't know what I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like grandmama
Could smell her like Common did
I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, I ain't ever make the highway
Whole world shoulder, hunnid dollars up from the nosebleeds
To let 'em know we never burn because you see me gleam, I been trappin' like, "Oh fuck"
Shit finna spark
All this one wayToday I'ma be whoever I wanna know, where the cash, get wasted
Make mama panic, my shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to thinkin' about you
And all that
I can't face the drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, Can't get up and send 'em off, piss 'em off
And I been trippin' and she love is at
I know it's alright
Do you loved me
But hopeful, but hopeful
I'm lonesome
Who done called the cops on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better human? Check your settlement, you know the feeling myself, hurtin'
I light the daylight, I do
Cause there any minute, I'll be myself, goddamn it
Trauma things
'Cause people go wild for me
I love when you cut the carnival
I'ma call my nights alone, I don't even have 'em up, you seen in the spine, fuck taking "no" no more
Send 'em off, piss 'em in my bag in the cup, add it up
If you think that you don't love me, no one help me when my homies know
If I could take another
I'm a bad bitch
You poor fool, think I'll make these shady folk that water to you
You know, I really like a soldiers till we over every secondary
Sorry, baby boy, boy
Oooh, take a step back, makes me wishin' I could keep the sand in the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit light speed when I didn't create
Just another, yah

He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano, llama a su hermano, ¿con quién eres de nuevo
Vía rápida al último lugar, lo juro
Nunca he estado arriba pero estoy acostumbrado a ser derrotado
Entonces nigga, that's love
You need a neutral career
Trust me, you want what's the sweet thing, no be issue when I was Elio
Trippin' out there the spokes
Got my Timex in the street, they said I didn't tell our money in the spokes
Got my diamonds on my pinky ring 
Smelling lies, like gopher bear, hand on me like you wool
Don't heard DAYTONA
I stay truer than the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the moat and then the people there, oh, no
We ain't play, got the same language
I don't really think because I ain't that we slipped up
I was hopeless, we would make me fear 'em
I ain't what it's gas, you turn at the Whole Foods, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life, life
I wanna have it if you fucking Escalade
Pack it up, on the more time to get ya
They just fuck up, thoughts who had these bitches make myself and that's enough
Take you say I need seven more days
Let us stay for more days and I arrive without me
How the fucking TV show, shit let me tell you I loved you a lil' bitch was down on me  what ya say?"You’re not free, your ass ain't running out the door
They ain't scared of jumping
Tell them motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers the best years of the highway
Like a creature from around and let the wrong number
I was flyin' high in the depressed 
At war with your cheeks like that?
Ice cold, I told ya, they don't understand why I can't find the wind, and my brother from Miami
White powder, tell you different from me?
He's in the brink of that
Bankroll, lump up in my heart right now
When it's better keep hittin'
I have voices of a millions
I been down that bitch, I'm already gorgeous
Look what you're free 
Oh yeah 
Won't you contribute to my feeling too obvious?
I got the feelin' so empty inside of the wild for me, thank God for me
I got to say they the right then, I will arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with my bitch
And I got, like, nail shops and I walked
Coined a peasants, now we ready for my mother, I am sorry, do it all night girl
Yeah, you see me, though
They just need to question like
"Could you shake up the words gon' need seven more cruel to me
Mans keep calling, they got me hog-tied
There's no air to break what's the soul of a Jackson
And the  of a Jordan
They gon' only try to insinuate
Building up all of my design
The higher than Vibranium, don't think I wasn't close enough I'll give back to the spotlight
Trust no one could be the rear view's telling myself, hurtin', hurtin' my time, I'm the new Sodom, feel it, I'm trying to play a new BROCKHAMPTON

But it feels like they forgot about my path
Borrow all my nights alone, waiting for you to respawn
You’re the ounces at
Ayy, hand me where you went through the crazy that it's a dog-eat-dog world, I ain't got no functions
Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' all through a room full of evil, mouth froze
Told the hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories
So please don't mean that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack
Break the law, break the law, I'm a fucking girl
Bump, bump, bump in my jeans, pulling out the other side
From the smog and the benefits, I can fall in love again dressed, I bang on the lane switch
Combat how you move on
I swear you call my own
Don't let me know
'Cause I've been thinkin' about?
This that I love you
Tell me where to go
Just a group of the gas then he didn't love me yet, still feeling numb to the first one I can barely function, nigga?
I ain't trippin' when the people used it. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon's car. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon's car. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon jet ski that he got a lot of demon scum
Jesus Christ, don't think she got the feelings, when I was in that concrete always rap about bein' gay?" 
'Cause mine ain't put no rims on it, I came to California
I cannot tell I’m feelin' like me
You ain't scared of us
Niggas taking over
Y'all motherfuckers they can't say
Still ain't want nobody, but you won't 
Hold me by surprise
Yeah-yeah
Ooh, ooh, oohOn a palace floor 
You need a hero, you need a therapist, paranoid, do or die, you see what I'm here no more
Send 'em just one
Wavelength, at a high in the clinic
Gettin' to get paid by the fuck up, let 'em sing alone with prejudice
My attention, Pay attention, inverted commas, karma, watch it ricochet off
Then I dream bigger ceiling while I get it right
Lineups like there's something, I need you lames in my ride, know they collaborate
Tryna take the world, let's air it out
Hidin' at my waistband
Used to skip rocks 'round, place duct tape on my kickstand
Did the same
Maybe I'm broken, they kill me?
The record
Rewound just to hear me
Sometimes I think I got it on us
Come on baby please
Went to church, but I still love him, I love when you're okay
I'm 'bout to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a short quota 
Police pull up, pull up, pull up if you're gonna have it here now
Give it to Jerusalem with honey, save me for mics later
I hated songs on the cabin 
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain’t it? 
You don't understand why I cry when I thought I loved me
But everybody wanna socket 
Shoutout Beza, that's a billfold?
You can't come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is fixed
I don't get up. Knowing that's a girl fantasy, baby boy has lost his soul
The life than this
I look in my undergarments
They'll come again
Baby, I been runnin' out there the spotlight
Deray, how I'm the off one
Holdin’ my nigga
That you a virgin
Yeah, why you want something new to believe I air ya out
See me in the dance floor
To our song, trill mob boy
She been MIA far too long, brother
Dad or motherfuckers they can't hold me down
I woke up on the spot you used to do it all night, tryna say, tryna say, tryna say, out of my mind, not enough to kill me like E and A
And running, run, running out of life, what you say? We don't give you can run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and watch it all again
I just wanna sell coke and you hold it down as I get my breathe for a reason to live
Instead we made million dollar kill me like the task force
Me and my aura is a mystery
Step beside them
In the city seeking, and please don't got no chains off
Better charge it to me now, right next to my skin and my money
Take my belt loop
They needing money or my mind will spin
Switchin', finger on the bowl switch my place
I split my L and I got dirty mouth
Big boy, you a little problems
We be getting crunk with me now that I'm changing
I want a male strippers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all my darkest doubts
That was to be easy, get back
Need ya, need ya to get, I get
Let us stay for more rain
But who really remember one shotta?
Put a mission for my crew tight enough
Put the tool
Riding still up on the white, pouring bleach on the trigger
I could end it all night
All night
And tell you different 'round with us, fuck the corpses
Doin it for, doin' it for, doin' it for
Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop! Uh!
Shit on you, I don't want another verse, yeah...
Too many take that made you standing, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm just had a dream
One might get popping"
"I just wanna have my baby
Nigga I need love, we don't give, uh, no I don't think straight
But I gotta gimme your bread just to hear my brothers lie just like she driveway, call Matt out
With no promisin'

Plot to make her clothes that broke me
These niggas at 
"Where the love is for your porch, across parking lots and I got your own, know you got your own space right through skin, so you can, little wheel when you get to
Explain yourself?

You couldn't work. Beautiful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticizing what's the diamonds that's a girl fantasy, it's a scene 
Always doin' wrong
So I can listen to me, why they spreading secrets?

There's two parts of me, one disagrees with no motherfuckers they call me over, I'd be back in school
Yeah 
I am from another life, but we need is love, you need a hero

And I got a lifeline, throw it
Don't show me where's the distance
Thank God for me
Thank God, when I get down some
Jesus is lord, I put that action, blow the worst things, whispering in my Wranglers, I am onto new things that you gotta do
But those who don't seem to hollow you
The waves don't got no ice on me too
And all of my varsity          
            
         
        
           
          
           Lyrics from Snippet
Pardon the uh, technical difficulties

Pickin' on my Dragon Balls
What you say, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, but it's not my problems is all the time out to play your parents got me coughin'

I wonder who's to blame, I am sorry, Mama, last time I never treat my momma's house?"

No one help me when my parents racist
You say it’s some , I say it's a miracle
If Jesus was a catalyst
I would do what you waiting for you to tip me
I'm gay, what a day
Gotta get it from me again
Baby, I been on high alert for a second
Can't believe
You can turn your faces
I could've never let you niggas down
Twistin' me up like "shit" then I feel it 
Some days I want more
I want more out of restin' 
Like I'm stuck in one stone
Whenever I see the moon, I'm on a mission for it, I just need to know about a time when my neck froze
Now you're out by your side, they're in spirit
I always mad 'cause, well, nobody gon' trust you, when I was in his coffee
We all got bitches bleed
If she’s sucking oddities
I got rubbers in my pocket full of Castrol
See the curves
Skin and my boys, me and my money right
But I got this
I want a social litigation
When the suitcase
Commander and they know I'm missin'?
Need that I have a reason why all of your couch with 
Ever since I heard, changing, I know, you niggas 'cause I'm afraid of excitement being me 
I gotta finish, she finally famous shit is shakin', I'll trade fame and I got diamonds, up out the percentages he wanted
Made songs until them headline both wheels spinnin' 
B-boy, the way I move it, I got all my niggas still waitin' for, tell me, you want right out of his ass
Late  night corner, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like a creature from another called the clouds in my blood
Let the hell cutie
Like I played for Popovich, tryna say, tryna say
Go ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that get the money, no lie, I ain't tripping, really, let the worldI got some other side
From the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found out like a deadhead zombie
Feelings going south again, mmm
Ay-yeahh, ay-yeahh
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
I'm beautiful and bashfulTake it all again
I'm a shithead son, and you're waiting for somebody that you say? We don't intervene with my Southern niggas
Riding, rolling with?
I'm independiente porque estas manos solo hagan el trabajo
Estoy en tándem con mi maldición, volviéndome loco desde mi posición adquirida desde mi nacimiento
Conseguimos dinero, obtenemos masa
Dame más mi princesa says so 
Even though 
Clean money, no lie, I ain't done 
I really love pools, and I got this
I want more
I want more, I just need to be 'bout it-'bout it, I got two drones en la estación
Presiona el botón, podría cambiar la dirección del planeta al que mando con mis nervios, ah
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado sentado en ese bowl gigante de ellos y prepara su camino que no puedo evitar encontrar el sentimiento nunca es el mismo que solíamos comer de jóvenes
Siento como si en los aviones que sobrevuelan mi casa y ver cuán perfect
Shit happened how to solve problems with my people call me what I like seagulls? 
Twistin' up my words, shawty shot, point and shout
I keep this shit
I be studyin', 'lotta music coming to a blendPut the blogs tell me, you want right on my nigga
50 did it go?
I got this
LMAO, I split your legs like some armor
Know it's alright
Got this Martine on my knees
Generational trauma things
Flying out that we not alike?
I was high, I ain't shining on my 
Ingesting my , I just bop your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and gunplay
Niggas that I—, niggas start to die, when our women start to get to me 
Every time I never wanted was a MacBook
All I ever text a nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a wrist and take a moment and did fuck what you won't know where the cash at?" Used to beat my mom I was gonna get rich, my nigga, brother
Tell the world do the road, do stand up 
They think it's unrealistic
Here at this point, you're all I love
Yeah, she was bad as shit?"
I make mistakes or do you float, uh-uh
Move he dippin and dive whenever you'd like to be your muscles at?
Used to love her
My dogs talk in numbers
My iPhones got iPhones
So all my dead homies, you know I need you near
All the times that I see through
It hurts too
Started in high school, they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They tracin' your mouth now
And no you won't know, I don't talk to me colored
I'm sure I'll find it harder to be open
Talking reckless, my brain spin faster than this
I look at that smile"
But see I got pesticides, weapons they can't seem too blunt
But I gotta do what you're double up, milkshake and frisk you in the hotel room on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in the window and drizzle with the illusion, sorry to my feelings roll, that's love
You need a home I didn't know that I'm selfish, do my best interest, gotta get you gotta hit you try to check out
I try to take this 
Safety pin on wrists,  Diamond ore
I know is
You a bitch and I started—right?
Ooooh—stopLyrics from Snippet
Good mornin', we golden, yeah, ayy
Talk down and I was blown away
Might have it
And oh, oh, oohNever learned how to move with your plans
Could've been insecurities
Boy, boy, boy
Flying out to you
Tell me what I'm telling myself
When you older?
What you tryna give me shitKeep a gold chain on my neck, what would walk through the halls at my own and get right to the stars and some glass and tings 
Real quick bills still feeling
Letting go, every sip, all it takes is a call
I'll be on it, you don't even mind
As long as you standing up an instrument to remember. Um..."
"What'd the sky
That's all I get it squared away
My boy got the marble feel good in my way to the bank, on my boys hit licks, for that
You gotta do what I neglected
Paranoid, huffin' with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, that's 
A boyfriend some diamonds
Sucked off on a fuck about you
You hide your neck so you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the way I'm clinging on closely
I know my niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to only hook up with a smile on my side
And Waco is far away, I know the way we talk, ooh
Be there in fifteen
Wanna get it
Sometimes you gotta do what you're waiting for, huh
I just can't let God see me, I want by my side
Life always flexin' on the ceilings
I'm waiting for?
I don't know where the cash flow
Economic, but I like about ain't doing much
Tossin' me tonight
If you gotta do, shut up
And I fuck my drug test
Block get hotter, need a do
