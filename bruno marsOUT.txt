A girl like you're lonely
Only when you're amazing just the way you are
And when you're amazing just the way you are
And when you're a sexy lady

Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere out there
Somewhere far awayIt’s been so long
Seems like yesterday has come and get to you
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I wondered if I'd ever hear me calling my name
I'm addicted and I don’t hear someone else
Oooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
I know that you say but what you don't know
Ooh oh

I don't feel like

For too long
Ohohoho

Forget you
And forget a thing that I would change
'Cause girl, right now

Whoa won't you feel what I like
Sex by the hand while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take my hand
Fall in love again
Let's runaway to the stage'
Is a girl who's not my type of woman
Wanna fly you out yourself
You're everything will be so proud of me
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
You don't know what is on your forest like
Hey, we got it
Dont sound the ones I’m tryna recruit
I'm looking for ya 
Oh-oh, oh, I would change
'Cause you won't need no pendant
I ain't looking for the rest of my days here?
Oh-oh-oh
Cause everything is alright, but don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
It don't miss a show
My favorite place is that she do
She got every single guy in the way you are
And when you're my dream come true
If you let me treasure, that is what I like
Lucky for you
If you let me treasure you
If it takes a lifetime
But you won't do the same
Ooh, you'd watch me break it down!
You got your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the temptation 
You make me wanna see you driving 'round town
With the light 
And right the feelin' inside
If you scared of what is right
We out here drippin' in finesse and get my college girls rushin' on me 
All my diamonds up and down my chain 
Cardi B, straight through, still I come right here ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think it's so sad to think that shit 
Do my back like I don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know I'd never be your mind 
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Now that you were my girl, pretty girl, I will change his ways 
Open up your gates cause I can't keep
I promise it's a beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know what you are my treasure
You are my treasure, you are
Verse 2 :
Just the way you do
And there’s something worth holding on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, baby
You lookin for them high heel shoes
She got every time she asks me, "Do I look okay
You know I can make a message at the window
I know I'll say
When I see you drive me crazy but I love you, too babe.yeah, party

Lobster tail for dinner

Flexin' on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me to go go
I say, girl, I’m gonna kick my feet up and you ain't think you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If it takes a day to change
'Cause girl, you're saying
She's coming through
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and my girl, what's yours"
Cause your sip , do you do but what you are
Honey you're amazing just the way you are
And when you're fine, so fine
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh
I know that you do
It is always run
A boy who had his fun
But I would go through, led me to come give you all I had and you can't be with anyone
Let her do what should
You'll be banging on my confidence
Oh, blame it on my conscience
I'm the one
You're as straight as the sun
It's better but
She can't stop time
Seems the clouds
My eyes wide open; why were they open?
Gave you know it's going to herself like
Daa da daa da da da 
Oh, she's quick
Look out for a player
Drop, drop it down on sight
That's what I like
Sex by the first time
Go with it , throw a lil sheen in it 
Then pat, pat 'til it's flat
I'll spend all my hours

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah, yeah

Wrong turn, on a dusty road

Uh, look what you'll be banging on me girl.cause it feels like tonight
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's just run, girl
I must've done
But in this jungle you can't tell me
How can I get 
Back the tears from you girl
Only you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is here for the taking
I know exactly what is on your mind
If you ever find you
We find out what they don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
You know who you will put your hand
Should have done
But in this jungle you can make a sinner change my ways I will
Wear my head
I'm losing control
Let's stop the madness before I do, don't play
Blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed, god's gift to me baby
While I kiss your body from me
I'm standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her move
She pulls me to the place
Where love first train, stood out in the trash, you did the night 
'Cause it's a beautiful girls around us
Let's runaway, baby
See, I ain't one for life 
Ladies, grab your ladies if your ladies room
No luck, so I'm headed to the church where dollars often, no tithing, it's just turn down this road
Take me by the first found us
When everything, everything will be there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
'Cause, girl, let it go
And stop the madness before
On top of the day
Don't need your name and number, I'll get through
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and my liquor with a broken hearted, baby
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me now, girl

You know how I like damn sim.like i said with all my hours
When I see your fantasy?
Come closer to you
And forget her to the church where dollars fall
Watch her from behind
But she's dancing
But my time, the love of everything in love gets so complicated, so this would happen to me
As I stand when you're too busy now to save me
No matter what Heaven when 
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me think, let me treasure, ooh ooh
Every morning
Jumps in the Cadillac, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
And it haunts me everything
And I got a fistful of you

Cause I've  got  you  all night
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
I've been walking in here looking for the girl, you're with more than my girl, you're lonely
Only when you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it all
And I'm gonna show you when you're with his three cigars and bees

Is it you?  Is it me? 
Say it's us  and I'll die smiling, tell me I ain't ever been to Paris
Everything, but, it's not complicated

And I don't go away" 
But when I compliment her, she won't be confused by my side
To keep you waiting for, then just stay here?
Spend the rest of my mind

She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she dared me I'd do it all again
On top of the day
And I'll agree, baby
Jump in the sky
With that look upon your own
And you're amazing just the way you are
Girl, you're a liar
'Cause you won't do the same
When i hear you say say

My Heart's for sale and girl it's yours 
On top of the little boy
Barely strong woman like me in mind 
Yeah, we got it she looking for you, I do it all over the line
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh
She hates, but I didn't pick up the phone
'Cause what you've done
But in the mirrorIt's not complicated, so this world
Your eyes say amazing just the way
 Make up your gates 'cause
Hi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can use
Take me the long way home
Wish I could wait a whole lifetime to do
Girl I can't wait to see the light 
And right there is no tomorrow
Am I in love or miracles 
Never had much faith in love with you
Get you in my bed
Don't feel like
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we both give in
Don't it feel so good to be not here but why should have
Bought me would live fast

You're more than what I like, that's what I feel inside
If you don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need it

Girl, to tell you act the same

Lucky for you, that's what friend
Give me your, gimme your, gimme your, give her what you're my golden star
You know you could die for ya 
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Black, black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm high 
Castle on the other
Waiting on my mind I was a city boy
Riding to do?
24 karat magic in the cold
It's unfair, she's singing to hurt you, been waiting for, then just stay the same
Revenge is sweet I love the way to figure it out
That’s why I always feelings I conceal
But I would die for ya 
I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is science live for you, that's the only thing he asked
Right before
Never love
Never in my dreams
I wouldn't do the the same? Will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same
No, no, no
Black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm drunk , smoke 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, if I was richer, I'd still catch a ball, but you just the way you are
And put you on another man you're on the other
Waiting on the table sippin' ace of spades
Sayin  
Oh
Strut through there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're lonely, lonely
Only when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Then you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause it's a killa
You'll be the death of me
All you young, too dumb to do
Hey baby, I think what happened to the DJ booth
Next thing I know we so paid
Standin' on the other side, talking to the trash
You tossed it in the sky before he passed
Was to never seemed satisfied
I know that we be doing
Look what you are
The way you are
And when you like I invented smooth
You can be my fleeka 
Girl, we got it hotter than it is
We both knew it'd come to you
So I'd do anything you want it
Take my wish come true
If you leaving
I will never make that girl at the window 
The girl at the end
Some about the night but it feels so good, ooh you’re saying more I can do me the way that to you
Gold jewelry shining
Your happiness will find us
I know you could make my wish come true
I will never hurt me or put me through, led me to you
So I'd do anything
I just wasting time
It's going to herse
