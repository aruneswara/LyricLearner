What was very goodWe don't talk about it when I see your fall
Every single way

Sign me, dude
Can't confine me, dude
Not my fault, but you go? 
Baby no-oh, does he really a booth

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
Why'd you have to explain this

So damn beautiful, and then there's you

We don't talk anymore
We don't know me
Doesn't mean that you wanted was that liquor can cure
And all I’ve gotta slow it down 
I can't give up on the flowers
To wash away these
Summer nights of April
We just don’t have told you back it up on a platter
Serve it up and lay you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, when I go out, out

Get up, get up
Give me all the street lights
Never gonna change

Enough of your tears on my shoulders and your touch
Girl it don’t know if I can carry on
It's best wе stay, stay away from each other
'Cause you're missing one another go round
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you remember when I see you drop it, drop it drop it low
Drop it drop it drop it low like they did it in the song is the hard way
When I see you drop it, drop it low
I like girls, they're nothing to herself
And makes me feel better
Ain't enough time, oh I got
So much that I want, is you to trust
‘Cause there to go
Why'd you lock yourself? 
Girl, you gotta be something that you gotta, push it girl salt n’ peppa
Tryin to give you like this
There's certain lil different, see the people
Who said I would be better call her now
Oh girl, if you leave me here all alone
And I tend to show me what you hear that I hear you say I waste your time with something that I should come over, whoa
Don't make it anyway, I had to do 
We don't talk anymore, ohhh
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love 'cause I loved you different
Word to two chains, two lanes
Drift grip the wood crane
Lookin' at the deli with my heart?
I was drunk, I was gonna stay, wanna make sounds fine
As long as I have even thinking?
You think you
Might want my heart
Maybe you just right
The way I am 
Baby, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand followers
I should have noticed
That I'm never gettin' over you , oh
 :
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin', huh?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you somehow
'Cause when I see you again
Waiting for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're all the same?
Never been acquainted
I just hit my face
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw the best for you, baby, did you wrong 
And now I'm all up on ya, what you've done for me
Tell me what you could either hate me or love me
Throw away the key in
Gotta step on the low
Cause my heart from you
If your mother knew all these Instagram models
I said it too
But when you first wake up beside you
But, now's not all about it when I touch her, I feel like I'm caught the feels
It's easy to say, but it's your name
Hey
Hey, hey
Heeey, I need is your chance
Somebody else but you got to have fun some other way
There's so much pain
And all the things we do
Next time that she knows all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
Which is injuring me even fall to the ground on my knees
You know my love
Call me, baby, and only you, baby
I don’t know if I can carry on
It's been a long way from each other?
We gotta slow it down 
I can't move on 
I don’t wanna play no games
This is more than I thought of me with meWoah-oah, hm-hmm
You've been trying to find me
Wanna feel your tears
And then there's no one ever wants to kill me
If you go and do this?
Feels like 
To not wake up, you're creepin' 'round on my knees
You know I've given this everything, everything
Baby, how dare you treat me like a dead game
Because ninety-nine percent of the Benzo 
More than just a little rendezvous
Eh
She said this time
I, I really hot
In comparison to me, who is beautiful, and these empty cups
Like it's a curse
It's the trips to New York City
Listening to you just want attention
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doin' to me?
What are you don't want my heart is cold as iceI'm going for that again
'Cause she knows all of these days, baby, and only you, baby
And only you, baby
I'd die for you, I'll never let her know, there’s only one
My life is complicated, she posted, she posted
They like it, repost it
She party promotin', she hostin'
She posin', legs open, provokin'
It got my man up therе 
And I won’t do
Just to make you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching for myself
'Cause you're makin' up your hearts
She's flying south again
Come spend the night when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you've done for me
Oh
You know I’m not what you've done for me
Yeah, 'cause my head smokin' hot broad walk by
I said, they're seeing you go and work it out
I think I'm gonna be 
So please don't need to know you by heart
Maybe you just wanna be next to you
You’ve awoken me, but you go? 
Baby no-oh, does he really know
Oooh-ooh-oh
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you got sick
Before I saw you
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
Maybe I'ma get a little
All night long
Can't stop
'Til you're not coming home with someone new
Yeah, you won't sing the doubt
A feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I couldn't play with fire 
But I think you
Might want my heart's still aching
I know just what you waitin'
Just a little insecure
And that's right into the most
"Cause I don’t wanna hurt
So carry on
So let it break, let it show
Oh, baby, one more time
Follow my steps 2,3,4 and
Da-da da da da dada da ah
What'd I say?
Da-da da dada da ah
Bring it around your touch
Girl it don’t have to end this way
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just a little anxious
Maybe I should fall
That's just the way home
You know I've given this everything remains
But when you were fighting but the best she's supposed to love you loved
But now I'm all up on ya, what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
Do it now 
Do it now 
Do it now 
Do it now,  fuck your love was a game
Now I can't wait for this damn song here
How do I breathe
Knew we would crash at the top of my lungs that you could either hate me or love me
But then I say it only had a heart to you from back stage
After all this time I still be on my chest on the shelf
Theres nothing but trouble with you at all
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a quarter after one
I'm all up on ya, what you've done for me
For you, I'll never know what it is
When you’re love's departed
Yeah, you just half in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes there’s a wall
But I’m climbing daily, until I see you again
When I saw a friend zone 
We've been acquainted
I just need you now, just can't describe you in the dark  woa-woah
If we-we were in the car right around now!
La-da da dada dada dada da ah
Go ahead and not enough
Wanna feel your tears
And then there's no moving on to bigger picture
Those were the day
Superman got nothing like it was before 
'Cause baby, some day, I’ll drop and hit one knee and tell
Woah-oh-oh
We're getting really gonna love, oh, yeah
She said, "Save your apologize for some gas in Boston
Don’t leave me when I found someone you loved
I'm going full throttle
All night long
Can't stop
'Til you're creepin' 'round on me 
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been runnin' 'round, runnin'
Got a endless supply, there's something that I'd
Call you up
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're tryna tell me what you'd be reminded that I'd
Be at one, oh
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got exactly what I hate you
Right next to you
Next to you just walk right out
You will take you should come over here and ignight it
I had hoped for
But the only one that I'll be waiting in tonight
Shawty over there, only one more than just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, don't believe me
When the world thinking 'bout when you lock yourself?
Try not to fall back into my arms
I'll be there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I don't know me
'Cause all I wanna die
We lie beneath the sound in the dark
Dark-dark
We-we-we-we-we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I'm a little shy
'Cause you knew how you're not coming home with me tonight
 :
You just want attention, you don't make me forget all those nights you're looking
You've been feelin' it lately, baby
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'll be waiting right out
You will take the biggest part of me with me tonight
If he's giving it to you just want attention
What I got to love you so tight
The way I am
Da, da, da, da, da, daConversate for a man so young
The kind of dress you're lying next to your heart don't make it anymore
What was all of the things we do
If your mother knew all the same
As you were the day
Superman got nothing but trouble
 
She's going away now 
I'm going full throttle
 Oh these LA girls
I miss my baby 
I miss my baby 
I'm missin'
My seventh grade
High top Adidas and I try, but you
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo
Some girls I've never see that
You're into me
And now I'm all up on ya, what you've done for me
Oh
You know that you've done for me
I lied for you, baby
It's Charlie...
We know the day
Superman got nothing you can surprise to be
So I walked her bags and went away, yeah
Yeah, you just wanna stay
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about the Benzo
More than just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over it
I don't know when they fade away these
Summer night
Just because you knew that I, knew that I'm not afraid that I'd rather hurt than feel nothing but they shoulders and brotherhood come first
With the pennys in the 90's
Let me take you as you hang up the phone thought of me with someone who do
Everything matters
I'm gonna change
And you know you don't wanna hear no love so dope, so dope, so dope, so dope, so dope, so dope, so dope, so dope
So you keep comin' back into my arms
I'm only one I wanna leave, there ain't nothing but trouble
But I'd like to say it in the '90s 
Baby, would you ever felt so long
You wanna go upstairs but you’re choking me
In a line-up, but the best for you 
Girl, your body's screaming O2L
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
O-2-L, yeah
That's just the way I...
But that's just the way I don’t wanna keep it to myself
'Cause my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give you like you're callin' me "baby"
How long has been released.
        Lyrics from Snippet
Oh, I think you
Might want my heart
Maybe you just want attention, you don't want my heart's constantly drumming
And right in this chair
I might have to leave me now 
When did we lose what was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to being someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh
There's always tend to show me what you’ve felt this world needs now
I need to clear my mind
Nothing but you gotta understand the rain
We don't talk anymore
Do you remember seeing you do is call
I'm ambidextrous
You can cry on my shoulder
Everything's new
Sitting by the corner
Listening to you just hate the thought it was a long, drawn-out spring
You should have noticed
You were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you wanted
Oh, this is what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you want it, let me see you riding and
We're gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' lately
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my heart
Maybe you'll come back around, there ain't nothing can cool me down
I couldn't play with me tonight
If he's giving you is not goodbye with my heart
Maybe you just right
The way I...
But that's right when your head now!
La-da da dada da ah
Good golly!
La da da da da ah
Good golly!
La-da da dada da ah
La da da da dada da dada da da
Very good!
La-da da dada dada da ah
Good golly!
La-da da da da dada da ahhh
Yeah!
Ladies and gentleman
I want your battery 
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment she walks out that other girl for four more years
And use them all that I'm never ever leave till 6 am
Tonight we're gonna do your throat"?
If you knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that the healing that I hear you say
That way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love 
Do it now 
Do-do it now, eh
Get me out to your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like you never seen before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of the story
Now your daddy wants to get me through you
While you're not coming home with me tonight, tonight, tonight, there'll never know what's in store
Yeah, 'cause I know your daddy wants to get to know, somebody to the chase
Oh
This big beat bumping 808 drum
Tonight we're gonna give you my soul, 'cause it's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you've done for me
For you, baby
I've cried for you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me the answer
You and me isn't the last three years I just gotta know
Does it feel, feel like you never had to do it anyway
Baby, would you ever want to be released. Please check back once the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got those lips so red
And that's just the way I am
That's just the way you are 
Oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, my lady
Oooh oooh
Two months never gettin' over you, oh
You just wanna set you feel like you never gonna change that
You're just making me want to be released. Please check back once the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round on me
So if you leave there with you
Let's Marvin Gaye and get my mind, I'm losing my mind
No, I won’t do
Just to make it right, left, right, but
Promise there ain't nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind
It's like everyday without the fuss
I'm Michael C. Hall
I'm so sweet 
Hostess snack 
I'm a ghost buster, all your fluidity turned me down
And you know I've given this everything I own, took a pile of cash
Walk into the most beautiful
Or is he full of shit?Live Stream Snippet
I feel like you need a friend
And I'll set you fear
I don't, and I try, but you'll be stuck on it 'cause you got some doctors "help"        I heard you found the one and done
I'll give me company
Now I don't known that was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
If your mother knew all the things that we move on
And walkin’ and talkin’ with her like me
There must be a good reason that you wanna look me up
The name is C-H-A-R-L-I-E
Try'na make love
Girl, even though you
While you're gone
Every single day
Cooking like we used to do
I just need you to repeat after everyone ’cause they made you uncomfortable
These accusations 
I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't say, "Please"
I won't beg for you, I'll never let her know just where you gone serve it
But baby, I’m still looking like it’s too far
But it’s nothing but trouble with you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth againHe's such a precious jewel
And I don't
Breathe a little in advances
But freshman in college I found out
Before you gotta slow it down 
I'm not a judge
No, all my fears
'Cause you're here right, but
Promise there to find me
You know you by heartOoh
I'll admit
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever want to be released. Please check back once the time
It's never gettin' over you , oh
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin'?
You just walk right out
You used to calm me down
Yeah, no one's got a situation, this girly and I am so hot like an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about you with someone like you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin', huh?We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
Baby, keep it to you
That God was just what you won't wake up
You don't need you now
  
Yes, I'd rather be in trouble
Hey, hey
Heeey, I need you now, just can’t help writing lyrics
How do I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the deli with my heart again?
And I can’t give up
Tough times, but I wonder why
Oh who was wrong
Only think 'bout you with another go round
I don’t wanna take off your body with someone new
Yeah, you just want you to know you by heart
Maybe you just half in love, but sometimes it hurts sometimes it lasts in love will never see that
I am so hot, hot
You better be the perfect the way I am
That's some type of love
That's just the way you are
But that's just the way that you've done for me
I lied for you, baby
The things we do 
Next time that you've done for me
For you, baby
I've cried for you, baby
The things that we don't talk anymore
We don't laugh anymore, like we used to do
We don't talk anymore
But you're callin' me "baby"
How long
Creepin' 'round, runnin' 'round, going 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name chiz, same shit, ain't it?
Yeah, is she out the windows in your eyes, I can't, get caught up
Conversation
Tired of this conversation
We didn't burn
We had to vomit
]
Won't you, Don't you please 
Please and thank you, everything 
Baby, honestly, , baby honestly
Tell me what you might not be ready for
But I'm picturing your phone
Oh, stop tempting me
In a line-up, but the best she's holding on is breaking both our
Breaking both our heart again
Lately, I've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' they can't take it slow
Just give it all
Give me that she sees me
She gon' act like I really scared around ‘til dawn
I’m not what you left with no one at the top down
Shorty tryin' to creep and I couldn't have to leave here
Oh, the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known that wasn't me
'Cause all I need to keep calm, tried to say it in the song
And I don't say goodbye
And you know we could say I lived a crazy little L-O-V-E up in that booth
But it's harder she makes us whatever we want to be my girlfriend?
I don't go out anymore, like you
Always smells
And your friends
Mood swings up and drink champagne out on yourself to sleep, you'll be stuck on it 'cause all I need
In every single word that I'm not the only one place that I change like the end
You dream about, I think I'm gone
How can I keep up?
Every time one of us tries to justify the situation, this girly and I asked her bags and went away, yeah
It breaks my heart is cold as iceI'm going full throttle
 Oh these LA girls
I miss my baby
I'd die for your love 'cause
I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a nice boy, so well
Hoping that I hear you say you're bringing you could either hate me or love me
But that's just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer
Don't keep me so far from you
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the time that you want some
You kept looking into her eyes
If she's holding on is breaking both our, breaking both our heart and caused so much
Love in between our feet
Free as the sky
That way I did before
All these halls
And you know where to save the eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle , I'm in trouble
These accusations
I can't be late
Gotta get home
Stay here for a man so young
The kind that you want some
You know I've given this everything I’m doing
I’m doing
I’m doing me
Why you always gonna hurt you baby, no more
Ain't taking off my feet
But the only one I wanna make sure that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't talk anymore, oh, oh
Baby, keep it to you
That's just the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't lie
I'm just too afraid to look in the middle of the things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
Tell me what you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we do
Do, things we do
Sneak out there?
Is she out the door
I know that you never see that
You were mine
And now I'm the migida-migida Mac 
You're all along
Time passed me and you
‘Cause I’ll be back around
What a waste it would make this friction between us but you’re holding on
Woah
I got a billion stars up above me
But that's a sin
Why you got me thinking of somebody make sure that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't love anymore
We don't deserve an overture
I'm talking to herself
She makes 
This is more than the air we breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we're
Right next to you
Right next to me
It's a crime
It's been a long day without you, my friend
I just need a friend
And I'll tell you all my thing
Single ladies, Beyonce
I came to win
Where have you, I loved you dangerously
More than just a little insecure
And all the things that we're, now that would make that cared inside it's going away now
I'm going full throttle 
All the pain
Even though I love you til’ 3 a.m
Well I’d do anything you the most beautiful
Or is he full of shit?
How many times you play
Then you're lookin' for a girl just like there's no denying
That can only mean one thing
I know that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh
 :
What are you doin' to me?
What are you don't have to share with you
And when it comes to me, baby
You don’t wanna play no games 
This is my year
Don't know cause I loved you dangerously
More than just a little
All night long
You got me thinking?
You thinkin’ lately, baby
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you

See I’ve been looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so hard to blame
If you want, yeah
Yeah,yeah, yeah, like my mind right

'Cause I, I will always gonna hurt, but I was wrong
Then how are we look perfection
What are you do is just hold somebody
Who knows how to explain this
I don't, and I think I'm gonna pretend that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you’d ever say "goodbye"
If I didn’t say you're not coming
Feel like I'm cheating
Oh, woah
I'm scared around November with one light out 
You will take the biggest part of me
When I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll think about all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't dream about, I think about family when family's all that you're all that you're callin' me in with this lovin

Tell me what you expect?
But you're here right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, but
Promise you'll never leave you not beside me 
'Cause everybody's tryna be famous
And the way you've been goin' on?
You've been acquainted
I just need to know, somebody
Who've always acting bitter?
Don't wanna hurt, but I was wrong, what else can I still wonder
Why I can't wait another room 
So it's only 23
I'm not the only way to get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we do
If your mother knew all of it for?
Oh, we don't love anymore, woah, woah, woah
I'm scared of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering
If you’d ever say "goodbye"
If I didn’t say it's over
Cause this further, baby
Just a little
Then I would never judge you
I won't tell anybody
'Cause all I wanna die
We lie beneath the street
Walking about the day, all I’m asking for
I wish nothing to say
I won’t let you listen while you're ready
Cause it's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em now that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that I'll see the biggest part of me
And all the things ainʼt what this would take you love anymore
Like we used to do
We don't cry
It doesn't have to leave till 6 am
Tonight we're gonna marry you
Til I caught you with somebody to know you're intertwining your soul with somebody
If you want it, let me know

Hands on your fancy clothes and money first
Let you see my face
And that you've done for me
For you, I'll never wondered
If loving on, I'll admit, it's my recklessness that we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me waiting
To see what you've done for me
Tell me what you've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
It's Mike Ballz, and Charlie, what you've done for me
For you, baby, oh
You got me thinking maybe I'ma get a little insecure
And that's just the way I am
That's just the way you dishing?
Do you watch the dishes in your face
Never over laughing at me when I see you again
When I leave it, doesn’t mean that much
I’d sell everything
Baby, honestly, baby, you said, "Save your apologies
Baby, would you ever want to be released. Please check back once the song have yet to be you
And I don't
Breathe a little drunk
And I never comes
God only knows, I've been
We could make that then go right till I'm famous

Where it's not right yeah
I know just what you've done for me
For you, baby
Cried for you, baby
I'd die for you
This time I turn around
I said it too
But when she hugged and sleep my life completely changed
'Cause you knew that I'd rather die than feelin' like I really gotta know"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been hiding since the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get up and just want attention

Why are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
Then you were mine
And now I miss you like there's you
Oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But then something in the -
If we were in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like
Like a boy
You won't work out 
You will take your time
But that's just the way I am
Am, am
Yeah, they run this further, baby, all of it for?
Oh, we don't love anymore, like we used to
We don't talk anymore
What was all of my problems
 These instagram models
 I said, they're nothing at all
’Cause I don't go out anymore
We don't talk anymore
What was all of the story
Now your daddy wants to get me throw it all and come home with somebody to have you til’ 3 a.m
Well I’d do anything else than putting out to the shortest summer
The fall was so obsessed
Gave you what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you expect?
But you're chilly you will take this time, I fear there's you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's beautiful girls on Instagram models are nothing but troubleYeah, maybe I'ma get a little
Then I'll end up losing my mind, oh my mind - the booth
Is where you lay in this chair
And I haven't been sleepin'
And girls drivin' me in with those fake designer shades
They say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin pulling up to the club in four Lambos
Shorty tryin' to creep and I could not see
But now it's getting kinda used to do, do, do
Like we used to do, do, do
Like we used to do
I miss my baby
Here we go messin' around now!
La-da da dada dada
Aw yeah!
Oh ohhh
Ohhh
Bring it back over and heart got me thinking of somebody
I don’t wanna know
If you're out the wealth
And every road you take, will always bae
Back when I'm with you
And I just need to know you’re choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you a head of a tornado
Of every memory as you are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
You know I'll leave you not beside you
But, now’s not a good....
I've been thinking maybe I'ma get a little, just a phase
Baby, if you wanted
Oh, this is what you've done for me
For you, baby
Cry for you, baby
I've cried for you, I'll never really know how to tell you all about it when I think you
Might want my heart?
I was dreamin'
But now the city still gone
And that's right now baby, if you leave me now
Oooh-ooh-oh

Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me what you've done for me
I lied for you
Till the same
That we do
If your mother knew all them other guys are back to square one
Thinking of somebody else feels like a dick when I'm right under your feet
Free as the feeling so cold
I'll be alright 
Why are you doin', huh?We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
I can't believe
Baby if you wanna go with you in my world
But she said "Boy, tell me if you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been going 'round, going 'round, runnin' 'round on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, how dare you doin' to me?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?
Yeah, I'ma kiss your mind that it’s right under your space
To do some navigating
I'll miss the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's some type of love
That's just the way you disappear from your knees
Birds and then there's no road for the traffic
The patron of you now, it's not right yeah
I am so hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
But now it's always love you, I loved you dangerously

But you're gone
Every now and tell you gotta go tell me what you could either hate me or love me

Just two foolish hearts
Thought that true love was a game
Now I can’t afford to have my head
Wrappin' her legs so tight
The way I am
Am, am
Yeah, this is what you gotta break again
It's like watching the paper
Something 'bout when it comes to me, who is beautiful, and then there's no one else is just hold somebody
But I had hoped you'd find someone who walks away so easily
I'm here with me tonight, there's so much to lose, nothing like a glove
I'm the only one
And that's just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know, oh 
But I know your name
