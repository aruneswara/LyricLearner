You like it, I like it, mama, just stop a nigga bitch
Yeah, red, red bottoms 'cause I need a little louder, oh
It's all in your plate 
Get a little tipsy
I'm about to get on
But I'll fly away  from your life
I can tell, I can see your net worth, baby, we made it
All of my life, yeah
That's my baby 
Speed it up, I want you to holler
Doing it too, it's what you want me anywhere everything that I miss it
I done met a lot of money, money, make you use it, get it 
She know me, no, baby 
Pleas
