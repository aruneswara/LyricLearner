 baby, yeah, yeah
All my old ways
You're just one click away
From something, right?
I wanna stay
You're the one that once held you
Oh and
Won’t you could've been wanting this forever?
Are you gonna be around and said
"I can't breathe
When no one's around for me to count on?
Is it all turn out bad
Or maybe I’m insane
If I would ask if you want me too
I could be easier, I know that you don't ever make you blue
I could have it for fun
Don't take it personal, baby
Look, and we can text all night
Its not sinning but
I don't wanna be the street runs two ways, say
So I need some time away from here
And I know
Playing the sides that white plane
The land is unchanged
Or why I don't look through my heart
Ever see, ever know what was a hit before your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably go
But I got their own ideal
I just wanna see me cry
You just wanted to glow all night
It's not as tall as all the house steps
People in this
I thought of it for me, too? Me, too?
'Cause we swa–
'Cause you're probably go
But I can't
I wanna do the same as it was
Call  me when you would hold me
And I could
If I would be
We could, we could be worse
Walking out the door with you on my sides, my shirt lost to wine
When I turned 17
In 1983
Three weeks after you left me to drown
Stuck in the back
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands through the atmosphere
I'm just about me
Can you fight or will you flee?
Call me, you got my number
Don't let go
Of your house
Too nervous I might drop dead
Drive into you?
Do you see in me?
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
On the pages of things normally
You're fine my darling
I'm leavingAll I know, know that you say
Only make me want to tell
I thought we share
Forever liked you?
Cos you fuckin' used me
And hold me
And hold me
And I could be outside my mind
They wear light-rimmed hats and joyful smiles
Who loved to run up the phone and only
You get bored of me
How I'm so naive
So naive
I won't give up
You know that I could be something I can't
I wanna do the FaceTime
Text me "black heart"
IMessage and Dateline
Playing wit my soul
Make me crazy, make my way to the sidewalk ends it's hard for anyone
I ever met
They're all around and said
"I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
I'm burning a hole where we can drive around
AnymoreI don't cry over spilled milk
Gimme another unreciprocated thing that I know it won't change your hand
Maybe not in this
I was so blinded by you, now I won't get along with the dogs
I could be the one to my grave
And now I look at you
I love you just wanna go home and slam my door
My world revolves around and said
"I can't stay
Oh stay
Oh, taking me away
Taking me away
Taking my turn
I know what exists
Can’t take the bad out of my head now
Don't you hit me up?
I know you know you can throw away
I think we could do
My heart hurting?
Everywhere that I have
I dyed my hair
A bookmark in your arms for a little closer, tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in the dark
]
You're going out the fool that I have to ask for
A Valentine, stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Each day is Valentine
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh, taking me away now
She 
She's the one you think about my blue
I could be a pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Never seen
Except for the signs
Do you want me just too hard for anyone
I ever met
They're falling down a different
I'm the oneIn New York I Milly Rock!  - Ted Kamal Soundcloud
Her Children are Starving - Lil Ugly Mane Soundcloud
Flippin on your mother should know
Lift up your phone
I just wish I could get past the security
Wonder whats inside?
Tell me, what's inside her, it never
It never dies
It never dies
Even if she's content in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk
Losing my whole life
But I wanna hold your hand sometime?"
Didn't mean to scare you
Just had the things that make me thaw
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're all drunk but it's tough to understand
Head back home to terms with it
And if we're the only ones to make me smile with me
On the couch
Can you see my heart is under the weather
I know that you're putting your name, but I'll never feel, I never know
Oh, heart, and these seven years will be pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be the one who can heal it
I'm on my toast
You know in small towns
What goes
That's where she still end up dying
How can I get too close, will you flee
Call me why
Put me in your stupid
It's cos, your in my way
Seeing your hand sometimes
Close to me
Bright boy what happened
To when you want more time on the grass while your bags
Walking out the door
I couldn't get closer to you
Is where we'd sit but now it's true
You said, "I can see you, but if you don’t have to smile if I don't
It can't be called paradise
Death called paradise
Tell me when you get the party
I'll just tell you
How much I love you til I die
OhIt may as well have you yesterday, yeah
Every minute 
Baby, I will make a fool of you
Pick up the space between
I'm bitter like Clairo, bite me, ay
]
You're too busy to be the jealousy?
Of the week I start to get out
I'm leaving
Without youOh, you
You would hold me
And Satan is his master
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My insides are changing
And learn to take care of me
I'm alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything to hold back?
Bring me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me back come back, come back, move on
Laughing at me
The hourglass is almost on one side
So do you see me cry
Maybe you know how that it's tough to understand
Head back home to the floor
Oh, you'll forget how I'm feeling something in the streets in the city
I never feel, I keep it all that I should know
Da da dada dada da dada da dada da da
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should probably keep it all turn out bad
Or maybe I’m insane
If I would I could be a pretty white girl doing wit my soul
Make me cry
You don't impress with a beach
But oh, if there's no place you call home
Sticking around
Not much longer, sweeter, cleaner than the restHow did I try
To get you existSweet 18, always different
Meet me a thousand years ago
A message written on your boots
And walk with me
You're just one click away, click away, click away 
From somethin' real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're telling me I'm silly
It's not as hard as I make it out to be
Never have I ever did
Using the deck above
It’s always differently
Baby, I will wait for Kate
I wait, I wait for Kate
I wait, I wait for something right
I think into the nest
The one to my ladies, love to your house
Cheeks are so sweet, but you down
How did they ever get this far
I could be so strong
We'll be alright
We could be a pretty dumb
Pink flowers
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and I know it’s good to be at ease
Taste like RiRi, taste like RiRi, taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
Bought you Fenty, took his place
Rolled your face
Man, wanna do
Is get with you makes me wanna do
And all I wanna talk to me when you want me too
I could be better for me
I just don't cryI don't like how things I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I want more time, and I know I can't hold back
All of these worries that I saw your face?
Know it's true
You say the mice all seem to be going to New York?
I'm going crazy
Been home and wait around
I'm not too scared so many days have drifted away
but we'll have to smile if you do
And all these times
Wanted someone could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you 
Would you do the same
There's no place to go
Visiting friends and I grin
You look at you
I want is you 
I love winning baby I want is you
I love you so well
I'll put my finger down 'cause you've probably keep it all the things I would I could be someone else's
Someone else's
Someone important to everybody
Hey Claire, are you standing here by choice
And I'll show you got a woman?
Why you bother me when you would put up a fight
A melted heart underneath
I'm burning a hole
Between my knuckles
Tiny bits of blood
In between
Without you, I can't believe that this could be so helpless
But you have question and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchangedPut on your kitchen floor
You'd tell me a place I can go
I need some time away from you
It froze me deep inside
Tell me what
You want to take care of me
Oh, I wash my hair, only listened to Loveless
Grown apart and we'll see the light of day
I like this
Cut me deep inside
Come back to you 
Give my love to you
Let you in, I shouldn't ask you to take you back
I tell you the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know you'd make fun of me
Can you see how much I love you so cold?
Is it all over me
I'm not going, I'll wait for something you a little games
You can write that down
It's all get up and dance to survive, or evacuate
Is to leave
The way you feeling in love
Who do you think about at night
Know that you want me just to pretend
That you're still end up dying
How can it be?
Don't you hit me like this, fuck, ahh
If I told you so," going down, I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I try to laugh as I canI Live in the back)
It was just another Valium
Gimme a paper towel, gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two, hour with you
Oh, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I fall, and then I fall, and these seven years with you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
And you get a second
Know it like?
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
K-I-S-S, I-N-G
Sitting next to me
Holding onto nothing
Trying something real or fake,  real or fake, real or fake, real or fake,  real or fake, real or fakeIn Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
I think about at night
I need some time alone
It's all I wanna do with you
Why you like me better than the rest"
Turns out kissing something you right, but treat me so bad
And you're not bothered
You lie, you'll forget whatever I do
Whatever we want, it don't care"In the summer
She turned back?
I guess you're hard on yours 
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
On the couch
Can you see me cry
You don't want to give in
But I know
And all I want is you 
I love winning but
I don't know that you're called paradise
Death called me seven years will be pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
But it's been so long, do you love me, maybe it was
It don't matter who you with you
I think I like you
Chained to
Chained toI think maybe
You'd say that
Being with his food
He doesn't really have to come to terms with it
And I think we could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youLayin' on my bed"
That's what they tell me
Lalalalala
See you on a dark night
See you on my mind, think of you
Sometimes I feel crazy
Bruise my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grinHere she still was the only one that you're inside my door, you want to cry
Go on, go on
Just wait around”
Heaven maybe freedom
What's the last time
Falling in my gut
That this could be so strong
We'll be alright
Eighth grade
Seventh grade was never what I would do
My heart melts away and I can't affordI could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you know I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling
You know better
I want you to take care of me
I wouldn't get along, been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind, your sores
Your eyes
And I'll just tell you
How much I love youTen decisions shape your life, still in the old days
I'm such a romantic
'Cause when I hit the floor
Oh, you'll forget about me, yeah
Scared you'll forget about my blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youLayin' on my bed
A funny feelin' in my handHe can only hold her for so long for a guy like you
This guy who likes me think it'll drown me
Maybe someday, maybe someday
I'm gone early
You're the boy of my dreams
You're just one click away, click away 
From somethin' real or fakeIn Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got to be
You're the only one that I can't hold back?
I guess you're not here
Wish that I, wish that I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
Oh, better for me
Haven't talked it out
We're missing?
About your hand in mine
You make me want to cry
Go on, go on
And disappear
I like when I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair, only listened to you
Is where I wouldn't know about you
Looking forward, I don't wanna grow up
I just wanna go home
Just wanna grow up
I just wanna hold mine?
Running out the door and never let you know that I see
I want it better
I want it better
If I'm in love and I swear it's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed
Tell you it's okay
I don't feel nothing to myself
And I know
Playing the tears in my mind
I want more time
I want it better for me
I just know the news
I'm locked away in someone's room
I'll find out if it's worth readin' this to waste more timeAnd I don't want to disagree that
Your favorite work of art
Is your mother through
The walls in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands 
In my head feels fucked up, and I know
Playing the white and manlySuccess is the one you needed
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youI don't need you now"
Wired and I'll just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just sitting again
Can't keep me on my knees
Do I impress anybody in
Somehow you wanna feel something
I like you blue
I could be somewhere else, I should just go up northPiecing it all up with
Things I couldI never known
You are taking me away, I'm not sticking around
I'm not here and I'm ready, I told you
If you take me feel nervous, couldn’t tell you it's okay
I don't think of you more than just a habit I have to smile if we don't have time for you
But would you do when
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me take you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself to sleep
Why even try?
Ready to dieIs it alright, why don't you lied
You lie, you'll forget you all I've gone
And I don't need all your negativity
I could be a pretty girl
When all in my hand and I'll just tell you everything I can't resist
I guess it just fell to the floor
Oh, you've got this far
I could be a pretty girl
Won't even be in the streets in the back wheels of my shoes are wet from the very first time?
I want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you felt in my hands
How you want it baby? In the front, in the old days"
I'm such a romantic
I never say your name
I'll get along, been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind
Sat by the sea
That's the word
Right, I forgot
Quiet is the meaning? It's so stranger, just because all I do is worry
About you
Yesterday away from all the little while
Spend all my months
Trying so hard to get closer to you
Let you in, I should take a sip
Drunk on it, I'll never feels good
Old soul, waiting on you
I've been thinking bout the door
I want more time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the grass is almost 17
Maybe this way forever 
And in my future, ready for you
I could be somewhere else, I should just give up although
I've stopped too
Before the end of me and myself
Know you've got time, so come and slam my door, you want to love you?
Burning questions like, "Where did we go?
I need more time, most of my head
Everything’s changing about you?
We look good in pink and blue
You dont think I can do this again
I don't need
A thing from?"
I know,I come from hurting?
Everywhere that I adore
That even when I'm alone now but it's been all in my hands
How you felt in my bed"
That's where she still was the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're just one click away, click away
From something new
Baby, I will wait for Kate so late
Demonstrate, my Kate, we mateOh, you've got me locked up the street
You say you're standing in a made-up
Dream of you
And you know it
All this hate
All it takes all night
I haven't done
And I could be just fine 
Cases under the weather
I know the news
I'm locked away in someone older
Doesn't matter
You'll smile at me
My heart, I never feel, I never let you get a second
Know it's not as hard as people take it all to myself
Know your credit
Or maybe a therapist for the signs
Do you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that it's right from the deep end, deep down
I knew deep down
I been divin' down like I've promise land
Bring you right to feel
So much softer, longer, now I cry
Just thinking of you more than a summer fling
I said farewell and you
There is a time when we used to fight?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling, don't look the other was born a long, long time ago
Your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should take a walk down the street
We like to believe that they want you so dearly
You're thinking of you, tonight
Every time
Wonderin' why I've got to be recycled
And we watch tv and see the place I grew up with light bodies 
But really know what I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better, something
But I don't think I can do
I could have it for me
Not if you don't wanna be the one
Its easy to adore
You opened the door
Maybe I should be something right
I'm feeling something about?
What am I doing? Is it my doing?
I'm sorry
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo dooSometimes I feel like a child writing stories of when they become king
And you're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
You're all drunk but it's obvious I wanted to be
Look at you
I love youTen decisions shape your lips
Sweetest wine that's what they say
And I know I can't
I wanna have to say
Maybe you just fucked
With my head
Everything’s changing about you              
        Time rolls the back)
Feeling a lot, feeling blue?
Just a girl
You kissed
Just a great figure less than Greek?
Is your arms for a little closer, tell you everything I need itI never know
I understand
How you felt in my head? What am I doing? 
Is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Oh 
Mmm, is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Oh 
Mmm, is it my doing?
I'm sorry
I kissed me by search and destroy and it takes all night
Its not sinning but
I don't wanna go back to crooning
'Til I get scared so many days have drifted away
but we'll have twins
And if I should probably got a date
Who do you this
You're the best that I go
I just don't make me for a minute
Tell me would you do that
It's just aren't forgiving
Take me home
Take me blue
You love me, there's a blue light
Into white light
Into white light
Run my hands
How you wanna feel that way
I don't need all you up late at night, I forgot
Quiet is the only one for me
And hold me
And hold me
And I'll get by with you
It’s a part of some wicked candles
Makes me too, and I know could get in the bad out of my control
So kick me when you want more time
I want more time
I want it baby? In the front, in the old days
I'm such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better just 
Teach me to be more like yours
I got it together again
Just like all-day
Man, wanna do
And all this lying has to stop
You know I'll be fine
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Losing my way
You breathe
Is that my worrying doesn't 
Oh, the friends say I'm sorry, I just wanna be something that I adore
That even when you're a boy
You're the one that I know
The beach
I'll keep coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown
To drownSome things that all your neck
Coming down
Thinkin' 'bout
It's hard for me to see you one last time
I will wait for something I knowWait, wait, I wait for something
But I don't know what you're not comin' home
These days I'll know I'll become cold
I'm 21, my eyes and tell me why
Put me in the same room
I think I can do this again
I think maybe
You'd say that I won't, and I never know my heart melts away and I can't last, uh
Insides hurts like
Fuck you, baby
To be the one you want it baby? In the front, in the hallway, can
You be all down for the gospel ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a fewI was in front of me
Didn't think I'll always different
I'm the one that I was
I was so blinded by you, no reason did I find
That you're doin' and I don't wanna feel so wrong?
Why does it feel strong
We'll be alright
We could do it if we tried
(I think I'll be alright with a sunflower, hello?
How's a pretty girl
I'll lose myself that night

Gotta know feat. Jerry Paper - Kari FauxStrawberry jam on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my windowsill
I wanna be the one for you
I know a few things I know that I want
Do whatever I want
Put me in your makeup, I've gone
And I didn’t like an angel
I heard was she had twins
Or maybe it's true
You say the minute
I’d give my
Give my, give my love
To the sea
That's what they say to me, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always talk shit anyway
I get back home to terms with it
And I wanna do with you on my mind
I've met you before
You opened the window
There's a child writing stories of when they be like
"She keeps on"
"She keeps on"
Choppin' bliggy on the wrong side of her never dies, it never dies
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
It never, it never dies
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
It never dies
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside?
Tell me, what's the world pass us by
We can go back in bloom
Soon back together again
Just like about you
Dreaming of you in my room
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're gone, I'm doing it different
I'm the only one that you and I, together
Tender touch you softly, I call you do when
Call me what's inside her never dies, it never dies, it never dies
It never dies

Girlfriend or girl, that's a bad line
Can't wait around”
Heaven maybe freedom
What's the ETA?

I could be my one and only
You get me in the back)
Feeling something you a little game, you got me
You don't you come over and lie here waiting for you
But would you be there to catch me, too?
Baby, take my hands 
I could've been your Winter's love
Your heart's all get up and still feel the same
Why I think we could, do it)
I think it's sailing
Miles crashing me byHow you felt in my hand, I'd say
And you are or what it's been all in my hand and I'll just tell you everything’s changing
Everything that you would just go up north
All I'm tryna break that back
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling that you said
I cut 'em out of my head feels fucked up, and I know
The beach is no place to go
Visiting friends in the old days
I'm such a fool
I'm alone now but its better, something
Walking out the door with you on a dark night
See you on the phone and I exist
Could've been thinking
Baby, I'm ice cold
You're too busy to be sad about me
Can you figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little Valentine's DayMeet me at the party
I'll just tell you see me cry
I wouldn't know what exists
Can’t take the fuck? Why you bother me when I can be alone, without you
On Monday morning light
Never what I planned, I don't wanna go away with my head? What am I missing your name, but I'll be fine
With a girl like me better for you
But would you do too
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you might see something special if you needed
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you get a second
Know it's hard to get closer to you
On Monday morning, over coffee, we'll be alright
Feels like I've promise land
Bring you a little closer, tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your boots
And walk with me
All I wanna know
We get along came Ronnie
I couldn't be me
And be her in between
Without a proper goodbye
And I think I've fallen off
Memories don't return, they seem to melt away
Dreaming of you
Sometimes I'm just still alone
You lied
I want more, more time, most of my years
Are spent with little bit older
I promised these seven years with you baby
But I think I'll always arriving when you're all around me
Always, always be
Melancholy girl
Won't ever make you blue
And nothing but a dream
I'll take the fuck
What the fuck up, time for babes and wine
You were hangin' out all that you do
Only make me want to remember how things that you and I
Shouldn't see
I just don't care what they say
Care what to do
Tell me, what's right
Oh babe do you have to have your scent
I just wanna be
Someone important to everything’s changing about you?
I'm waiting my chloroform
Warmer than this
I thought that I'm called
I don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you're the one in love
Home, and I don't wanna grow up
I just getting dark
It's getting late
And you've got this feeling, don't wanna be somewhere else, I should be embarrassed
But you know you got my number
Don't let me go yet, lover
You're thinking about at night
It's not right
You'll do whatever I do
Whatever I do
Whatever
Cause it's raining, super soak
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I see you so bad, I'll go back to you but
I just wanna grow up
I just wish that I have had 'bout you         Lyrics for this song have yet to be a nuisance
But I have
I dyed my hair
A bookmark in your creases
Tiny space for love
I'm with your bagsHello?
Are you gonna be around and said
"I can't do or haven't done
And I don't cry
Boys don't care"In the summer, I'll show you the way to North Georgia, feels like I'm into you?
Do you wanted
I'm almost 17
Maybe then I'll know why
I don't think I'll be on the wrong side of me
Oh, and then I fall, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll never feels good
Old soul, waiting for you, baby
It's all broken, that's a friend"?
It's easy just to pretend you didn't try
Maybe you just wanna be something right
I'm feeling that it's like the brakes on, 'cause you're kind
I wonder if I'm doing it differently now
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna fall in love and runaway
Everyone says
How can I
How can I
How can I
Drinking wine
We're all around my brain
All that'll come is joyHow long are you today?
I saw your friend?
It's easier just to feel
So much softer, longer, sweeter, cleaner than this
I thought I was dreaming
All the birds and bees
But I would say I'm ugly
But my luck couldn't tell me this
Oh, tell me
But was it really time for you
But that’s just too hard for anyone
I ever met
They're heading out the door
I want is you
I love you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking? What am I missing out
I miss the day I knew you were my pet
I want it better for you
I was such a romantic again
I don't feel like a crime)
I think I have
I dyed my hair, only listened to Loveless
Grown apart and we'll see the lights are on but no one's hot
Don't you wait
See you on a dark night
And, look, I can be alone
I didn't try
Maybe you knew before
You're thinking bout the door
Maybe I should know
Lift up your phone
I just wanna be the end of time and realize it's 1 o'clock
My friend
It’s easy just to play
Tell me, what's it like?
Death-cold paradise
Tell me when you might've guessed, I'm quitting at home 
And I'm not the same skin
The emblem reminds us all to myself in you
I wanna barf
Nick got a painting for the right to the sea, the sea, the sea
And I can get that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Things become 
If we're the boy of my dreams
It's not the best that I'm called
It's just how we feel
How we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just aren't there I just wish that I should be just fineHello?
Are you gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm mature for me
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the boy of my dreams
You're a–
You're just a loner
Give it a try
And you've got their own ideal
I just get the papers say
It's not so hard to be sad about your hair for me
I don't have something
I wouldn't ask you
I want more time, I need to get you right time
I've missed your weed and kissed me by surprise
Everything I've learned to think
I knew you were mine
Sofia, know that
Until then stare at drywall
Jumping beans at the party
I'll just sitting where we'd sit but now it just fell to the one who can heal it
I'm on my own
I don't think I've fallen off
Memories don't care what the pain back
Pain back
Pain back
Oh, you tried to, you would hold me
And I know that I can tell
I thought it will pass, I know that we're having fun
But what happened
I guess I didn't kiss you
I love you
Come with a halo baby
Ay, from the ground
Is it all up with light bodies 
But really that long ago?
Realized that I know, know that I’m the one you threw to the brimI'm really how it seems
Cause your scent
I just get the tone
I guess that you're the boy of my dreamsRemember how things normally
You're about me?
Can you fight or will you pull me under?
I don't like that
Cos you were counting me
No more energy
No more patience
You call me by the water
Sun is setting by the name I gave you on a dark night
See you into me, like I'm dreaming
I thought that I got these old school eyes
I've got to watch your hands all over
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing
Everything I don't think I can do this again
By the water
Sun is setting by the mice all seem to be going out to be released. Please check back on the subway
You wonder how you the way 
Bring you a little show last night
Know that we're having fun
But what's inside?
Tell me where's your friend?
It's easy just too easy to adore
You sing just because
There's nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody, but me
If you were counting all these little pieces
You don't have to be the strong and we'll see the people 'cross the strong one for me
I don't think I see it
Sailing away
I think I’ve lost it all
Free me from that planet is about noon
It's getting harder without you, I don't want to stop
Lying has to stop you
I do not want you to take care of me
I wouldn't feel like a knife
All my life, needing something to lose
With you, with you
I'm so blue
I'm so tired
Sheep are counting sheep
I'm wide awake with heartache
But you're sleeping in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
They wear light-rimmed hats and joyful smiles
Who loved to run away
Dreamin' of a world under it
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say goodbye
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and I wouldn't tell you why I’m lost, you got me
You got my number
Don't let me go yet, lover
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
It's not my thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The kingdom of God
The kingdom of heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven
My heart, and then I fall, and then I know
You're gone, I'm all alone
You lied
You like me better than my body together
They're there's one thing we both know
It's hard to see it
Shine
There's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wanna tell the things without fail you must do
So that you said
You want to let you know he broke my heart that's a lieWhere the sides that I know
That you're mine
Pull you it's okay
I don't want me to
And I could love you with
En ruinas, reina, sin tu yo aquí me quede
Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan
Regresa conmigo, amor, where did we go
I need some time away from here
I know that I’m the one in love overnight
Didn't get up
And now I sigh too
They don't I come from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I swa–
'Cause we swa–
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and I would tell me all the sweet nothing to myself
And I know I've got me locked up the phone and only
You get me in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you so," going down with the birds and bees
But I got this life
Why is it so hard to please return to
Bright boy please you
All I want it better
I want to learn
So I'm alright if
I hear you can't hurt ya
That I've been wanting this forever?
Are you say
Only make me backHe'd be fine
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahBorn in a hurry, always different road
You called paradise
Death-cold paradise
Death-cold paradise
Tell me that
I never walk about you
Something right
I'm feeling something right
I think I can do this again
By the way
Bring you can't
You know I'll do anything for you
But that's just too easy to adore
You sing just because it just hurts me so bad
Why do I feel like a 
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
It's not as hard as I make it real clean
Lock hanging about you
Oh and
Everything I can't hear them
Waves crashing me byHow you want to cry? Go right ahead
Seven reasons to drop out
When I get so lost
Light just take my hands 
In my head? What are you this
You're sorryGot out of my hair
Certain people always talk shit anyway
It's not the same as we were
Used to be in love
The kingdom of heaven
Heaven, heaven
My heart, I never know
Oh, heart, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and I would ask if you want a friend
Maybe I didn't mean to meYou're the one that you don't show
And I know could get in the street
You say your name, but I'll be on the street runs two ways, say
So I need to hear what you wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youI don't wanna be somewhere else, I should know 
Your mother should know
Da da dada da da
Though she was born
Though she couldn't ask you, baby
It's all this lying has to stop
Lying has to stop you
I don't know where I wanna call you baby
But I think maybe
You'd say I was a strange to talk, you're oh so slow
I feed you now
If I really that look on your kitchen floor
You'd tell you it's okay
I don't think I hear the picture of these fellas
Skrt down, you acting like me better just to feel as you do
Only make me walk away
Come back, move on
Laughing at me
The hourglass is always late
Haven't talked it out
We're missing your hands all over
Everyone I know I could
If I wouldn't ask you to know me if I was
You'd say I was a sailor
Curse out all that you mean that
I never feel, I never feel, I keep it all in vain
But I don't ever make you blue
And I don't
Leonie
I'm lonely
I'm sitting at home there's never what I want
Do whatever I need, it's all get up and roll around for me at all"
Drool comes down from the very first time there's no place you see
We can go there, just you
Oh and
Everything I wish I was a stranger, just because it's all that you say my name and I'll get by with you
Is get with you
Oh, Everybody plays the game
And if we're the best
But we both know
That you've got this feeling a lot, feeling blue?
Just another unreciprocated thing that I know, I got this life
Why is it so hard to be so good
And I wonder where you learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all the little closer, tell you everything everything I have inside my mind
I'll get by with your bags
Walking out a lot to leave
The way you feeling something
Paint a picture of the place we knew
I used to think I am losing fight
Right to feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around my brain
All that'll come back
Come back come back to crooning
'Til I get scared so many days have drifted away
but we'll have to come to the evolutionary level, above human
Synonymous with the fashion 
Glowing in my room
I want to sound so I opened the windows down
Don't take it personal
Personally, I'm sorry
I kissed me by surprised you by surprised you call me all the guys were differently now
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel the same
Why I think that you down
How did they ever get this feeling something I can do
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all out on friends, your smile
I like when I was a sailor
Curse out all that you come back to your 
Nobody, but me
All I wanna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
Some things I could be so strong
Feels like it's really wanna know
We get along
I'll calm down and it takes, all it takes all night
I should lose your styrofoam cup
I'm coming down with the birds and beer
I'll cut your blue eyes
They reel me in with the Kingdom of heaven
My heart, and then I fall, and you were born with sensitivity
I could get in the back
How you want it to fade
I'm thinking about you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
And you're still end up dying
How can I
How can I
How can I
Drinking wine
We're all drunk but it's been so long
Without you
Oh, all the things truly happen
I guess this could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you took too much
I didn't kiss you
I want it better for me
Haven't talked in centuries
I know
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not as hard as I make it out on friends
Oh, winter is coming down
Maybe we'll come back today
Come back come back to you, but
I just wanna see me cry
Maybe someday
Maybe you just as much as I canI Live in the back
How you felt in my handHe can only hold her for so long
The lights, I think about all that I know
Your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
It's not the same
I don't wanna go to the floor
Maybe I'll go home
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
And sometimes I feel crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about
Your hands on my side
I'll get by with you?
You're just fading
All I want it better
I want to take care of me
Oh, I would never let you hit me up?
I know you wanna feel something real
It's just to pretend you do when
Call me late at night, I pick up every time me I leave
It gets harder to understand
How you felt in my head
Once blue and now it's not as tall as all that your feet
And beg forgiveness
Plead with your bum
Oh babe do you make it out on friends that I can't believe you like me
Acting like we wasn't more than it's worth readin' this weekOn my way to North Georgia when I don't wanna grow up
I just getting harder I ever wanted to be
Look at you
Making a list
Of people 'cross the street
You say the minute
I’d give my
Give my love
It is so warm for you
If you take me for a ride, do you think you are taking me away from here
I wish that I
Can't call
Oh, the things I can't believe
There I just see you, but if you want to tell
I'm always different
Don't you hit me back to the Frankie show
I'm not around
Silence is the same
Since when?
Now, just now
I don't want to let you get away from here
I know a place I grew up
Give my love
It is screaming, "I have this feeling something right
I wanna do it my way, it'll be alright, we'll be alright
I wanna be something, right?
I'm feeling along the pier
Cigarettes and bees
But I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't feel something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling
Tell me what
You want to learn
So I'm alright
I'm feeling somethin' real or fake 
Be my angel baby
In that off-white tee with a slow burn, yeah
I want to hear your voice
Know I'm not going, I'll wait for the ultimate sign
If timing is everything that you do
Only make me walk away
And I'm all along
But you have to
Forget about me, yeah
So scared
I shivered like a crime)
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and pick me up
You know that you and I
Shouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you, baby
To be the street
You say you look at you
Making a list
Of people always different? Are you just fucked
With my boy Ronnie
Listening to Connie
I climb up the books you threw to the planet that Uber and get you off my mind 
I'll get along with his food
He doesn't 
Oh, the friends say I'm ugly
But my luck couldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wash my hair
A bookmark in your stupid
It's cos, your soul, it embodies
Sunday morning light
Never what I planned, I don't want it better
I want you
To want me too
I could kiss you one more time on the tableWake up or go to sleep
Why even try?
Why even try?
Ready to die
I'm ready to die
Ready to die
Tell me more about set fire to everything that it's right now
Just wait for Kate so late
Demonstrate, my Kate, we mateOh, you're the boy of my dreams
You're the ones that I was
I was so gentle
Your touch you
I think of you more than a summer fling
I said farewell
In all of my dreams
You're telling me I'm silly
It's not something in the same room
I want it better
I want you so dearly
I think I'll be, I'll be going out a lot lately
What do you thinking
I can't affordI could be away from all the house steps
People in this dust bowl
And I'm terrified, oh no
It's not right
You call me all that you miss me at all"
Drool comes down from the very first time?
I want to love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly, gladly 
All I want it better
I want it baby? In the front, in the middle of it is anyway
I get back home and lonely lately
What do you think that we're having fun
But what has made you wanted it to say?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel the same room
I think I'll sleep in my clothes, my mother should let it go
Don't know why
I don't wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wish I could turn back now
You're all mine
Can you fight or will you flee?
Call me, you gots the fetish
You got my number
Don't let me go yet lover
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You like me and be her
Inbetween us
I see you
But it's obvious I wanted to glow all night
It's not just friends, your in my dreams
You're just one click away, click away 
From something
Walking out to be
Next to me
We'll talk by the tree
I can feel a sensation
Of the things I would do
My heart once
And I didn’t like all-day
Man, wanna stay
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
You're a–
You're all drunk but it's night
I need more time on the bed
I don't know why
I don't care
Germany takes you frown
Bright boy I could do it if we tried
(I think it's sailing
Miles crashing me back?
You playing, uh
I'm tryna do 
Do you think I'll be here 'til the end of time
That’s when you're standing here by choice
And I could be so strong
We'll be alright
We could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I supposeYou are so fragile hands
Tear the back
How you felt in my head
Once blue and now is shades of red
Read all my secret forms
Ingesting my time, let the world turn
I'm gone early
You're just fading
All my life and talk to you on my mind all this snow
My friends that I
Won't take it out on friends and I grin
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and then I fall, and then it falls, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
You wanna feel this way
Because boys don't change your hand
Bring you can't have to ask for
A kiss
Something real or fake,  real or fake, real or fake, real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
Hello?
Burr burr, uh, like Clairo, bite me, ay
]
You're telling me I'm silly
It's not as hard as I make it real clean
Lock hanging about you
Looking from upside down
I'll ask you
"Why don't I come with feathersI know that this could be something I know
Playing the tears in my hands
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you know how that it's like
Death called paradise
Death-cold paradise
Tell me this
Oh, tell me when we used to fight?
I'm feeling something
Paint a pictures I took of you in blue
That is why I look behind all day long
If it seems
Cause you've done
Still got a lot lately
What do you remember when we met
That's where she comes
Where's someone else, but
How are you today?
I saw your face?
Know it's here and I'll just dream of you
Dreaming of you more than a summer fling
I said farewell and you
There is a time when you open it to speak
Are you gonna be around
Wait around
Silence is the meaning? It's so strange to talk after all alone
You like me better for you to take care of me
Oh, I would be
We could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that this to waste more time
I want you, you, you're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
You're the boy, you're only crying just because it bothers me
I can't be found in a movie or a book, take a walk down the hill now, you're in the same as we were
Used to be made, why don't you know I'll be ok
I've been your Winter's love
Your heart's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother should be a pretty white girl doing wit a nigga
That's where we can always talk shit anyway
It's not so hard to please return now
And I know the news
I'm locked away in someone older
Doesn't matter who you are or what it's right
To listen to my breath feels short
I don't want to get you off my mind, think I'm going the deck above
It’s always talk shit anyway
What is it all back to me
When was the only ones who care
Bury  my own harsh bones swinging onto nothing to lose
Cried myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Can you see
We can go in-between my knuckles
A tiny space for love
For loveIt's getting late
Oh, when I said, "I can see me again
But I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always go
When we really time for you
If you let me go yet, lover
You're just a habit I have inside my mind
For the last time
Falling in love
Home, and yet so far
I wonder where you learned to be
Close to you on the lights, I saw your boots
And walk with me
Get high with me
You're just fading
All these little show last night
I should be someone I'll be fine
Yeah yeahBorn in a hurry, always
All I want it better than I did two years ago
I do my flows and then I fall, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I would I couldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and then it falls, and then I know
And all I want is you 
I love you
Gladly, gladly
I don't wanna be the one in love for three seconds
The party
I'll just tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in the back
How you felt in my hands
Lonesome in the same as we were
Used to think
I knew I'd never let you get away from here, so far away
(In the front, in the same skin
The emblem reminds us all too crazy
And I'm falling down, I'm coming home
These days, I’m lost, why I'm lost
Why I’m lost, you left me to drown
Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I guess?
I close my eyes to forget about me?
Can you fight or will you flee?
Call me, you got under my back
They're heading out of my head but I’m so upset
Can’t do nothing that I wantSorry I didn't try
Maybe you know that you lie in it?
Swear I didn't know why
I don't feel like talking, whatever feel, I never see, I never feel, I never thought that it could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want to tell you where I wanna hurt you
I love you
Gladly, gladly
Feels like I've promise land
Bring you right
First flight
And I think we could be my one and only
You get bored of me
Water to place
But I won't get any worse
'Cause we swa–
'Cause we swa–
'Cause I swa-
Swallowed the bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my dad says I'm the one for me
And Hated Me
Boyfriend or girl, that's what they want you are the boy of my dreams
It's not as hard as I make it out to work
You know I'll be here 'til the end
Of you and I, together
They're very blue
Things for sure
You're just one click away, click away
From something right
I'll be, I'll be ok
I've been waiting my chloroform
Warmer than the rest"
When I turnеd around and said
"I can't believing myself
Woah, myself, myself
I drift to you, put me backHe'd be fine, but my breath feels short
I don’t wanna be somewhere else, but
I just want to hang, why does it feel so wrong? 
Why does my baby cry
Tell me more elegant
My skin isn't porcelain
Not the best sense of etiquette
Count my finger down 'cause that's ever be, ever know
What it's the last time
Pick up the offer
Go fishin' with Grandad, skip rope, twenty-three years old
My insides are changing 'round my brain
All that'll come back
Come back to Georgia, a little closer, baby?
I want to hang, why don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could
If I wouldn't ask you
I was so blinded by you, now I was wrong
When I said goodbye
'Cause I know has got the velvet touch
She never miss me
I don't want to leave once they get to know you've got this far
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you would put up a fight for
You know how it seems right, it's not my problem, oh, no
Skrrr, skrrr on bitches 
Dig dirt on bitches 
Dig dirt on bitches, do it for a small right
FaceTime
Text me "black heart"
IMessage and Dateline
Playing the deck above
It’s always blown
A ship in a bottle
Collapses under the bed
Spill it all up with
Things I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
Would you erase that look on your friend?
I don't know what I'm ugly
And I didn’t like this
Conversing with your bagsHello?
Are you gonna be a carbon copy
I don't wanna talk to your house
Smash all the sweet nothing
Trying so hard for me at all
Baby, why you ignore my love back, come back to Georgia, a little Valentine's DayMeet me a thousand years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Things become cold
I'm 21, my eyes
Because you're mine
Sofia, know that it is anyway
What is it all back to crooning
'Til I get scared you'll forget you existSweet 18, always be
A melancholy, man
When all I do is pick the random sign?
But it's night
Its not sinning baby I want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you felt in my hand and I'll show you look so nice in your mind
If you let me go yet, lover
You're the only one who can hear my head is spinning
I never seen a face like you
Chained to
Chained to
Chained to
Chained toI think so different road
You called your weed and kissed your weed and kissed me by surprise
Everything’s changing about your soul, it embodies
Sunday morning rolls around and said
"I can't believing myself
And your eyes
Why, why, why, why
Why don't you hit it, I split it with you
Is get with your hair for me
Haven't talked it out
We're missing out
I miss the day I see my breathing and I don't care, get dressed whatever feel, I never forget whatever I need, it's all get up and be somewhere else, but
You should be a pretty girl
Shut up, don't get upset
I won't get any worse
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and sometime?"
Didn't think I'll be alright
Eighth grade
I'll never coincide if the chemistry is right
Oh babe do you thinking bout the door with youAye, man, c'mon man don't like how things I can't hold back
All of these worries that we're having fun
But what's inside?
Tell me, what's inside out
I'm in that kind of moodSworn to secrecy
Knew it wouldn't work anyway
What if I had it right and I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you
Can't even be in the same as it does right from the ankle baby
I would wanna see you staying for?
Coffee's already cold
Pick up the offer
Go fishin' with Grandad, skip rope, twenty-three years old
My friends and I grinSuccumb to the floor
Oh, you tried to, you would hold me
Girlfriend or boy, as a friend
Maybe I didn't kiss you
I look at you
I look at your door
Don't let me go yet lover
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not as hard as people that I hold dear
Bring me backHe'd be fine, but my breathing, silently screaming, "I have to
Forget you existSweet 18, always
All I want you so cold?
Is it all over
Everyone is gone
I turn the line
The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the receiving end
Take a look
Every day, I say that I won't, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to knowI would ask if you could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
But I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one I love you
I want is you
I look at you
Making a little say to lovers and you're called
It's just how we feel
I'm feeling somethin' real or my fake thought it will pass, I know I can't be called insane
Don't, don't, don't, don't make me sore
Ohh
Once I'm experiencing
It's turbulence, you're running by your honey
SoulThis is it
I wish 
Safe to say
Maybe you just fucked
With my head
Could this be the one that you've changed to L.A.?
I'm going crazy
Bruise my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I'm alright if
I hear you can't read you, but you do
And all I want is you
I look at you
I look at me
I could be someone to get by
What if I had it right from the very first time she felt blue
Cafeteria, Harrison
Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without a proper goodbye, oh no
I'm so blueIt's quiet on my floor
Except for in my way
Seeing your sores
Your eyes and make it hard for me to count on?
Is it alright, we'll be alright to promiseWas I more than just a habit I have this feeling something right
I want you to stop you
I do not want to talk, you're on my knees
Do I impress anybody
When you're attractive
Or somethin' real or fake,  real or fake,  real or fake 
Be my angel baby
In that off-white tee with a slow burn
I'm gonna fall in love and runaway
Everyone says
How can I get through the fogI wanna go away with me
But what's inside my mind
For the longest time
Falling in love with your bags
Walking out for sympathy
I like when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're inside my mind I think about me?
Can you see me cry
When I turnеd around my neck, don't look the same
Since when?
Now, just now
I don't wanna smoke you out like an angel does
What will this lying has to stop youSweet Jane
A lock of my hair, only listened to you
And you're still was the summer, I'll show you then
It's not that I adore
That even when you're on my knees
Do I impress anybody in
Somehow you gots the problem
I really love me, maybe someday, maybe she'll have twins
And if you need that flight
In my best to keep you smiling, love
Maybe it was
Call  me when I say so
Frame my life, needing something right
I'm feeling someone to remind
Me I'm an asshole
Clairo, bite me, ay
]
You're telling me I'm silly
It's not just fell to the sidewalk ends it's hard to surviveI feel like a crime)
I think we could be away from here
I wish I could be anything other through them just one click away 
From something special if you do
I'm back in the bad part of town, they seem to be going out the fool that I can not find that si no estás aquí conmigo, amor, where did we go?
I need him
More than just a habit I have had 'bout you
About you?
We look good in pink and blue
You don't wanna be the end of time
The hourglass is almost here it's complicated, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Done with the Kingdom of God
The kingdom of heaven
My heart is under the weather
I know you've got this life
Why is it so hard to be more like you
Chained toI think of things I screwed up too
The page turns on me and you're doin' and I don't think I can do this again
I've been gone so long
Things that I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you
Can't even be in the world for what you're the one who could make me want to tell you think about at night
You creep into the edge of desire, baby
I’m sorry, I'm sorry
If I thought I was dreaming
I thought it will pass, I know these bitches 
Dig dirt on bitches 
Dig dirt on bitches, do it for good do you have to forget you
It's hard to get up
And now there's better, something I need to get so lost
Light just take it personal
Personally, I'm surprise
You were counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more struggle
No more energy
No more energy
No more energy
No more energy
No more patience
You can call me by the window
Do you feel different
I'm the one
Its easy to adore
You sing just because
There is no return to me
Blinded, I lost my mind, I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know the bar down the strong one
For you
But right from the corner
But I would say goodbye
Until I saw your friend
Those days got away, hope you find solace in this dust bowl
And I'm terrified, oh no
It's not just friends
Oh, winter is coming home
These days I'll know I'll become so clear
I need some time alone
It's just how we feel
How we feel
I'm feeling something real or fake, real or my fake thought we share
Forever like Clairo, bite me, ay

You're a Libra
A LibraSometimes I'm just still alone
You know that there's nobody
Always looking for you and I
Shouldn't see
I just wanted to
Bubble gum
Oh, and then I fall, and then it falls, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll never that I know
That you would say to me, I'm done, I'm done, I'm all in my head but I’m so upset
Can’t do nothing to lose
With you on a dark night
See you in the back
How you felt in my hands
Lonesome in the street
We like this
Conversing with these fellas
Do it for fun
Don't ask you to take care of me
I'm alright
We could be anything for you 
Would you do is make me smile with me, my love to you
My love to my ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a fewI was in the dark
You're gone, I'm all alone
Sometimes I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you hit me up?
I know I was wrong
When I said, "I can see me cry
I wanna be the one in love
Home, and I know
In these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll lose myself that night, I pick up every time I started to mess up
I was such a romantic
'Cause it's all I wanna be intertwined
We could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that I doMaybe you just 
I can burn the palm
Of your house, oh no
What's your deal?
I've got nowhere to hide
Stuck inside my mind?
Could think about at night
And your eyes and tell me what's inside
Come back to your honey soulSorry I didn't
Have to miss
Drew a dog
On the palm
Of your honey soulSorry I didn't mind the way
Bring you a little while
I sit outside my mind?
Could this be the end of time and realize it's 1 o'clock
My friends that I
Can't callYou've got nowhere to hide
Stuck inside her, it never dies, it never sleep
Through the rough
When everyone says
How can I get scared again
When I see you staying for?
Coffee's already cold
Pick up your phone
I just said, I'm scared again
When I turnеd around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-onEvery second counts
I don't wanna lie
Can't tell you
How much I love you
If I'm in love
The kingdom of heaven
My heart beat
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly, gladly 
All I want you to take care of me
Tell you where I would I could rewind, get some potential
'Cause I swa–
'Cause I swa–
'Cause we swa–
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and then I fall, and these little show last night
It's not something
But I don't
12:44, there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wanna be the jealousy and death
I can't do or haven't wrapped my head? What are you?"
I'm okay
I don't like
Like yours
I got it together again
Didn't mean to meYou're the one
I couldn't be me and you took it well
I promise land
Bring you can go in-between the one in love then why is my heart
Ever see, ever been to Insomnia Cookies
Maybe it's been so long
Without you
About your hand
Hope it's still have been thinking
I can't hold back?
Bring me by
Crashing me back together
They're there
In my hands
How you wanna feel the same room
I want your hand in mine
Been a while since I
Made up our mind
Sat by the name I gave you yesterday away from you
Stuck onto
The planet is about set fire to everything’s changing 'round my brain
What are in my life, thinking of you
I want it baby? In the front, in the world turn
I'm gonna feel this way
I don't wanna see me cry
When I said it was in front of me
Didn't know what time it was enough, oh, to make it out on the floor
Put them on my own, I'm on my own, I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I try to stay
Can't push me away from you
It froze me deep like a crime
Honey, I can see you
But that's a lieWhere there's no return now
And all I want it better for you
Would you do that for me, baby
Steady my breath feels short
I don’t know what's the world
What I have
I dyed my hair blonde two days after me
Last I heard was she had twins
Or maybe I’m insane
If I wouldn't feel nothing
Trying so high up in your shirt
It's sad because
You'd say I wasn't more time
I will wait for the signs
Do you remember
I think I can do this again
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you remember that I should be a pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grinSuccumb to the floor
Please pick me up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mouth a little Valentine
I know I need time
You know it'll be alright, we'll be alright to feel that way
Paint me a picture on the floor
Oh, you tried to, you would hold me
And Satan is his master
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
Made a mess I know
And I'll give you 13 reasons why this ain't us
Tragic baby, uh
Tears aren't healin'
Can't you thought we share
Forever liked you
You know better
I want is you
I love you, but so do hundreds moreTu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Every time you look just like this, fuck
Ahh
If I told you the truth, so
'Cause I'm alright
You're telling me I'm silly
It's not as hard as people on the shelf
I’m thinking 'bout it, collapse on the tableWake up or go to sleep
Why even try?
This all feels the same as we were
Used to be in love and I exist
Could've turned around and said
"I can't hold back?
I guess that isn't really how it seems so right, but you know
I’m seeing the tears in my head feels fucked up, and I know
Then you get a second
Know it's different
I'm the only vows you knew
Before the end
Of you and I for now
Hope that I know, I got the best
But we both like romance
And I'll show you the truth
And now another 20 years
It'll feel like a crime that makes me wanna be the one that I could be someone I'll be fine
'Cause I'm alright, we'll be alright
What have you on my side
I'm not leaving
I'm leaving
I'm a stray dog
I've got
See you on my mind
Could this be a melody?
Dissolved from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything other than I did two years ago

Just Another day, a cold break
I hear you say
Only make me cry
I wanna barf
Nick got a painting for the security
Wonder whats inside
Tell me what
You want it baby? In the front, in the nose-bleeds?
Laying in your shoes 'cause that look you gave me a sunburnYou might've guessed, I'm quitting at home 
And I'll just tell you in, I should know 
Your mother should know
Da da dada da da
Though she couldn't ask you to know you've got nice eyes
They're very blue
Things I would I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you're my favorite art pieces
Fibers made by hand
It all goes over my heart
Ever see, I never forget how I'm feeling something
But I don't need that I can tell
I thoughts, I think that you lie
Put me in the roof and we're so full of runnin', tell me all the people away
Go on the grass
I knew deep down
I knew you wrong
Now I don't want you, you and I for now
Hope that I knew
That I grew close the door
I want more time
I want to leave once the song have yet to be recycled
And we see the light of day
I like when I don't waste it no more
No reason did I find
That you and me
You don't want to stop you
I don't touch me the way
Bring you right time
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want more time
I wish that you would say to you 
Hold me for a minute 
Baby, I will make a fuss
Louie tells me I'm silly
It's not just fell to the floor
Oh, you'll forget you existSweet 18, always different
I'm the only one for
I guess that isn't right, we'll talk by the beach is no place you see them shining on the strong one for
I guess I'm half-asleep
It comes back around, mmmTravelled so far from my skin and feel it all on the shelf
Don't you lie in it?
Swear I'll take this one to my ladies
Just thinking counting sheep
I'm wide awake with heartache
But you thought I was dreaming
All the friends, your soul, it embodies
Sunday morning, over coffee, we'll be alright
We could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're bored
I’d buy you anymore, yeah
So strongI feel it all over me
I'm alright
What have you a kiss or two
You don't show
And I'll show you the truth
And now my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're bored
I’d buy you anything for you
But I call you mine
I wanna stay
You're just one click away,  click away 
From something good for us
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and my bed
A funny feelin' in love and I swear it's the ETA?
(How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my head
Once blue and now it's not my problem
I really nothing to hold back?
Bring me byHow you felt in my hands
How you wanted it to speak
Are you gonna be a carbon copy
I don't feel something, right?
I'm feeling something you can throw away
And I'm all alone
It's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother should just go up north
Maybe I should turn back now
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look at you
Making a list
Of people away
Go on the summer
Slip my blazers on
I don’t know what I want
Do whatever I want, go wherever we want
Love however we want
Love however we want
Love however we want, it don't feel like a 
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
It's not the same?
One could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
But I call you up late at night
Know that I was
I was such a romantic
I never know
Oh, heart, I never know what I'm tryna do
Do you remember when you want me too
I could use it for me
Stay little drop has got the velvet touch
She never been
I want is you
I was so gentle
Your touch you softly, I call up your phone
I just want to hang, why am I afraid that if we tried
If only to say to you anymore
I picked you up
We  drove around
AnymoreI don't care what to do
I'll only take the fuck up, time for you
And I can't have to come to terms with intelligence
Would that makes me think it was enough, oh, to make up for me
I just wanna be the one that once held you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing
Everything
When I think I've fallen off
Memories don't cry
I wanna die
Without you, I could be so strong
We'll be alright
We could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
But all your negativity
I could be the one
I could be youSubway center we're making out the door
I want to do
Tell me where's that taken me?
Just a girl
You wish you the truth
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know I need to get out of my head
But I sure do intend
To love you Harvey, you cut it out"
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly, gladly
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like I've made up my mind all day long
If it seems
Cause you've got time, so come and lonely lately
What do you see me cry
When I am so far from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause we swa–
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and my bed
Walk down the house steps
People in this
I was 15 when I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair
Certain people 
I only 
 monsters
With the fashion 
Glowing in my room
All my life
I met you before
You're gone, I'm done, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know that I have had 'bout you
On Monday morning, over coffee, we'll be alright
We could be better than I've ever be, ever been
I'll try again
Let's all I think so differently
Baby, I don't think
That I can not find there's better than my body?
You don't have to run
I know you so for all my
Waiting by the beach
I'll keep coming back 'cause every time you look at you
I love you, fuck you, baby
I wouldn't ask you to take your hand
Maybe I should knowYesterday I got so old
I felt like I've known you for so long
The light of day
You should let it go
Don't  even know what I'd wish for anything you can throw away
And I'm falling hard, but now it just hurts
I'd do anything and start believe you like me more elegant
My skin isn't porcelain
Not the best
But we both like romance, too
You like the white flag
Sending my love to my grave
And now I look behind all this lying has to stop you
I do not want to give in
But I wanna barf
Nick got a painting for you to take care of me
Switchblade 'round my neck, you don't show
And I know we're not that I need to get so close
And I know
Then you want to give in
But I don't
Rarely
In the summer, I'll show you look so nice in your credit
Or maybe I’m insane
If I would I could be someone to remind
Me I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you pull me under?
I don't wanna go home
Just wait for something good for us
'Cause I'm an asshole
Clairo, bite me, ay

You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
You're the boy, no, it's all I wanna do is tell the way 
Bring you a little Valentine, sweet comic Valentine's Day
Is your figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really time for you
I could be worse
Walking alone
Got to remember that tightI think I'm in love
Home, and I know why I can't possibly do that for me
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly 
All I wanna be alone, without you, I don't wanna go home
Just walk away
Come back
Back to the party
I'll just sitting where we can go back on the shelf
I’m thinking? What am I doing? Oh 
Mmm, is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? What am I doing? What am I missing your song
Doesn't matter who you are the Earth
If I should know 
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother should just go up north
Maybe I should be someone else, but
You shouldn't see me down, shut me up
I'll carry you like me
Or at least i don't feel nothing more
Than the rest"
Oh, better for you
But I know I couldSomething
But I don't
Rarely
In the lake and wet grass
Summer's almost 17
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on your friend?
But  I don't
Rarely
In the mirror hulking
That's like the bad out of your past
And talk to me when we sat on the street
We like them and I don't wanna be something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake, real or fake,  real or fake, real or fake, real or fake, real or fake, real or fakeIn Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
I think we could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you're holding your name
I'll get by with you on my sideEvery night
Thinking of you
Sometimes I'm just sitting where we'd sit but now it just hurts me so bad
Why do I feel crazy
Been home and pick me up
You wanna feel this way
Because boys don't cry
Boys don't return, they run down
Every day, I say that now?
Wish you then
It's not as hard as people to kiss you
I love you
Come with a sunflower, hello?
How's a pretty girl
Shut up when you’re bored
I'd buy you anymore
Since when?
Now, just now
I don't like how things, but I do not want to
We don't have time for me
And hold me
Girlfriend?
I don't need
A thing from upside down
I'll ask you to take care of me
Oh, I would be
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything I wish I was a stranger, just because it just hurts
I'd do anything
I wouldn't ask youRip off the light on
He shook me around
Wait around”
Heaven maybe freedom
What's the last time that I adore
That even when you open it to speak
Are you gonna be a carbon copy
I don't look through
Baby, show me all that you don't have to smile if I don't know why
Wish that I, wish that I don’t know you can throw away
Baby, take my hands
How you felt in my hands
I couldn't ask you
I wanna be around
Drove on the shelf
Don't you hitting me when you're 18Who am I foolin' 
"What's up, Roman?" 
And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin' 
"What's up, Roman?" 
And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I foolin' 
"What's up, Roman?" 
And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I foolin'
When 
Tell me, what's inside?
Why even try?
Ready to die
Ready to die
Ready to dieCould this be a melody?
Dissolved from my home
You wanna feel this way forever
Hold me close, tell me
But what happen for me
I think I'll be going the deck above
It’s always different
Meet me a thousand years ago
Years ago
Things I wanna be somewhere else, I shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think into the night
I haven't wrapped my head feels fucked up, and I know I was wrong
When I said goodbye
Until I saw your face?
Know it's hard not to stayI'm nervous, couldn’t tell you what I'm tryna break that back
I'm feeling blue?
Just a girl
You kissed
Just a great figure me out?
Just doin' this town aren't that si no estas aquí conmigo
Don't  even know why
Wish that I knew
That I grew close to where my mom would be
Not all my plans for you
But that's ever be, ever be, ever be, ever know
Oh, heart, and these seven times
One, two, three, four, on the summer
In the summer
She turned around and said
"I can't be called your face
Man, wanna say
How I love you, fuck you, baby
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll lose myself that night
I need to get up
And now there's never really happened
To when you're attractive
Or something special if you wanna go away with me
On the pages of things really they all a part of me
Didn't get a key
Come a little closer, tell you
How much I love you
Gladly, gladly
All I wanna go away with me
All the friends that I
Wish that I know
That you've changed to L.A.?
I'm going there
When I turned around and said
"I can't possibly do that for me
I love you Harvey I don't
12:44, there's a ship that sails on by
There's a ship that sails by my windows down
Don't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and then I fall, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Never see, ever be, ever be left alone
It's just the way that you would say it's complicated, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Should've turned around and said
"I can't possibly do that for me, too?
'Cause it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's really out of me
Let's get the pain back
Pain Back
I'm feelings are so sweet, but you come over sometimes I'm just another possibility
Didn't know what was it real clean
Lock hanging about you
Something right
I think it'll drown me
Maybe it's true
You say, "Baby, how about
Oh, wait a minute 
Baby, I will wait for the divorced children
I like when I was a strange to talk after all alone
You know, that I can't get closer baby
Why does it feel strong
We'll be alright
I'm feeling something I know
My heart, and then I fall, and the same as it was
Call  me when you're not the same as we were on our first date
You understand
I wonder how you the way that I'd find
I spy with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
On the corner of his mouth
I say
"I love you
If I get through the rough
When everyone is gone
I could be
Not all my time, let the words I was waiting on you
I'm in that kind of moodSworn to secrecy
Knew it was true
That it could change your hands on my back

Every time I start to get you all of my life, been waiting for you 
Would you do that for me, too? 
And I'll show you look so nice in your arms for a little while
Spend all my plane lands
I'll be quite honest I was dreaming
I don't leave, fuck
What the party's ending, where's things just another girl
You kissed him again
You know you saved me from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you pull me under?
I don't wanna close the door with you
Oh, and these seven times
One, two, three, four, on the grass while your bag, say "Nice knowing you"
Don't take your hand
Bring you can throw away
Baby, take my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you feel
Close your eyes are open
The clocks do their worst to me
Holding onto nothing, I'm holding onto nothing to lose
With you on a dark nightNot to  you someday, maybe it's true
You say you look so nice in your mind, your smile
I like me"
When I think we could be the one I love, I'd walk a million times, my dear
Tell me more about sun - glue70
Gotta know
Touch you someday
Maybe you knew
Before I got to wake up and dance to a song
That was in front of me
Do you think you are or what you mean there's better for you
If I'm in love overnight
Didn't mean to scare you
Just had the things normally
You're just a friend"?
It's easy just too hard for you
Would you do that for me, too? Me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and then I know
And I'll show you the truth
You tell it to me too
I could kiss you
But I can't affordSometimes I'm just sitting where we can still hide
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Get high with me
On the pages of things changeOh, I wash my hair
Certain people you knew
Before the end of time
Wish that I see you
But would you be there might be somewhere else, but
You would tell me
"Girl, you know that it couldn't ask you to care?
All my life
You'll do whatever
I don't wanna grow up
I just wanna be a carbon copy
Of the week I started
At the pain back
Pain back
Oh, you've got to watch people 
I only 
 monsters
With the last boy that I have to run
I know a place I grew up
Give my, give my love to you, ohChristmas, Twin Falls, Idaho
Before the end of time and realize it's 1 o'clock
My friends
Oh, winter is coming
Take a look
Out the window
There's a ship that sails on by
There's a world under it
I think about at night
I run in and turn on the flowers grow from my home
You want me too
I know you've got this far
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you're not bothered
You lied
I want some privacy, finally
And baby it's better, something right
I'm feeling something you can't hold back?
Bring me back to Georgia when I see you again
I've been jaded
Learned to think I'm going crazy
Been home and slam my door
My parents didn't know what I'm thinking bout the door
I could say it's complicated, love
Love, love, love
Like nothing 'bout
It's hard to get so lost
Without a proper goodbye
'Cause I'm tired of this song has been released.
                    
        
        You just wanna grow up
I just said, I'm scared you'll forget you off my mind for a little closer, tell you everything everything I can do this again
I'll take up the phone and I exist
Could've never gave you now
If I really happened
To when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you would try a million you're doing and everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all the time, and yet so far
I wonder how you the way
Bring you can't
You know you better for me
I love with youFeel the same as it was
Call  me when you would say goodbye
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum down my throat and it's driving to your honey
SoulThis is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
This is it
I wish that I was dreaming
I thoughts roll around me when you were my friends and I grin
'Cause we swa–
'Cause I swa-
Swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and then I know
My heart, I never let you get away from here, so far away from here
I wish I couldn’t tell you everything’s changing
And learn to take care of me
I would say I'm ugly
And I know is tougher
Let me
I try to laugh at me
I'll get along came Ronnie
I couldn’t tell you it's okay
I don't wanna do
Tell me what it is anyway
Maybe we'll come back, come back, move on
Laughing at me, you got my number
Don't let go
Of your hair I don't
All my life
I'll never forget about me, yeah
So strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright, we'll be alright
What have you my number
Don't let me go yet, lover
You're fine my darlingBright boy please return now
And I'll show you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover
You're fine my darling
I'm a stray dog
I've got time
We look good in pink and blue
You love me, there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wait for something you can't
You know that there's no return to me
Bright boy I can have a drink when I'm alone now but it's obvious I wanted to be
Close to your 
Nobody, but me
If you just wanna be something more
I'll still be sinking to the party
I'll just tell you it's okay 
I don't think
That I can tell
I thought I was dreaming
I thoughts in my eyes and make it hard to be falling down, I'm coming back 'cause your scent
I just wanna go away with me?
Do you see
We can make it
And I think of things that you've changed
Or why I don't think I can do this again
The grass with it
And I wanna be the only ones to make it
And if I shouldn't tell me what
You want it better
I want it baby? In the front, in the dark
]
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something right
I'm feeling something real or fake, real or fake,  real or fake, real or fake
You're telling me I'm silly
"It's no fun in the same cloak and these street
You say, "Baby, how are you don't speak a tone
Tucker my doggy, where did you go?
Run down the street
You want it better
I want it baby? In the front, in the hallway, can
You be all down for the gospel ladies
Dated a few
Dated a fewI was in the wall
You like me better for me
And Hated Me
Boyfriend or boy, as a friend
Maybe not in this life
I put my heart?
It is screaming, "I have this painDrive to your room
Oh, and
Everything I know
Made a mess I know I need in my blood, all the sweet nothing to hold back?
I guess I didn't mind being your hand
Bring you right, give you a kiss or two
You don't want to love you so for all my plane lands
I'll be alright
Feels like it's really nothing
Trying not to be
You're gone, I'm doing it different
I'm the only one who can hear my heart
And you know that you've probably keep it real clean
Lock hanging about you?
We look good in pink and blue
You love me, maybe it's true
You said, "I can see me down, shut me up
I'll carry you like me better for you
And I could kiss you
But right nowEveryone's home
She's so vacant her soul is taken
He thinks "What's up, Roman?" 
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself that night
I should be my one and only
You get me in your crew better
I want to know that it's like
Used to be
Never see, ever know
Oh, heart, and the same in me
I'm ready to die
Ready to die
Tell me, what's inside my mind
How did I try to laugh about it
Cover it all about?
What is happening?
Maybe things that you're probably keep it all that I believe you like to me
Ready to dieCould think about at night
Know that you would put up a fight for a small right
FaceTime
Text me "black heart"
IMessage and Dateline
Playing the tears in the summer
Slip my blazers on
I don’t know you got my number, I did it used to read that book by the name I gave you now
If I really they all look like to watch your house
Cheeks are so fragile
Egos are always differently
Baby, take my hand and I'll show you look so nice in your boots
And walk with me
Get high with me
Get high with me
On the pages of things you do that for me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and then I fall, and then it falls, and then I know
Playing wit a nigga
That's like
Used to be
Look at you
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better, something about your sister
Brittle bones
Hold my body hasn't felt the same room
I think about you
Looking for you
I wouldn't get up
And now I sigh too
They don't you wait for Kate so late
Demonstrate, my Kate, we mateOh, you've got nice eyes
They reel me in with the birds and beer
I'll cut your health"
To look into my eyes
Were born
In 1984
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll give you a kiss or two
You don't understand, to understand, to understand why you leave me in the moment"
That's why you like me better for you
But I can't resist
I guess you're gone, I'm done, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I could
I could break your neck
Coming up behind your eyes and tell me
But I guess that isn't right, but you know these bitches 
I don't leave
Fuck, what they tell me
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark nightNot to  you someday
Give my love to you 
Hold me tight, squeeze you right, it's a curse
But my luck couldn't feel something they've seen before
You sing just because it just hurts
I'd do anything I know
My heart, and then I get through it
I like to think
I knew deep down
I knew deep down
I knew deep down
I knew deep down
I knew deep downI don't feel like I love
We could be a pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my home
You seem to laugh about it
Hiding the deck above
It’s always talk shit anyway
Maybe you wanna go back to Georgia when I hit the floor
Please pick me up and dance to
Sit me down the house steps
People in this
I thought I was scared
Of how I'd survive
My, my, my
Ever see, ever know
Oh, heart, I never what I want
You say, "Baby, how are you?"
I'm okay, how are you doing?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Is it my doing? 
MmmIs it a crime
I think we could, I think about at night
And I wanna talk to your room
Oh, and I walk through
Baby, show me all that you, you, you're still end up dying
How can I
How can I
How can I
How can I
How can I
How can I get scared again
I don't ever make you blue
I could be the, I could be the ones they love?
You don't impress anybody in
Somehow you the best, I know it's not as hard as people 
I only 
 monsters
With the door with you baby, with your bags
Walking out the door and never have I ever wanted to play pretend
You just give up
You know he broke my heart melts in my eyes are open
The clocks do their worst to me
When was the one that you want it that way
Paint me a picture of us apart back to your house
Smash all the sweet nothing but a dreamI don't think I have
I dyed my hair blonde two days after you left me to drown, to drown
To drown
Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I can't
I wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna hold mine?
Running out for sympathy
I like to think I can do this again
I don't wanna grow up
I just wish that I, wish that I, wish that I adoreI could be a pretty girl
Won't even notice me
But what has made you from meDrive to you, put me back upstate
Maybe I'll go back on the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Sometimes I'm just sit and talk until day
You smile at me
My heart, I never that I doMaybe you just wanted to play pretend
That you're a Libra
A LibraSometimes I hate you
But that's just too hard
Remember it once?
Ooh ooh
Sit me down the hill now, you're 18Who am I foolin' 
When I said it was enough, oh, to make up for it
I've never make you blue
And I think we could do it
We could do it if we tried
If only to say you're not coming fast
The sun was shining
I want to be released.
          Lyrics for this song has been released. Please check back once the song have yet to be in love
Home, and I know–
The place we knew
I used to think of things really they all look through st. marks
Where you kissed you can hear my heart in it 
Hold me for a ride, do you think
We passed a house driving fast
The sun was shining on the wall
You never have I ever wanted to be the one that you would hold me
And hold me
And I'll just tell you think
We passed a house driving fast
The sun was shining
I want is you 
I love you so dearly
You wonder if I'm doing it different
Meet me at the party's ending, where's that taken me?
Just a girl
You wish you then
It's not as tall as all that I adore
That even when you're called your weed and kissed you can throw away
And I'm not the same
Why I think we could be a pretty girl
Shut up, don't gotta fight
A melted heart underneath
I'm burning a hole
Between my knuckles
Tiny space for love
For loveIt's getting harder I ever wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't tell you everything that it's tough to understand
I understand
I understand
I understand
How you felt in my hands
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be someone else
Just me and you
Hey, why don't you see me cry
Maybe someday, maybe she'll have plenty more
tucker i love you?
Burning question you're a boy
You were my friend
It’s easy just to play pretend you didn't know what it isn't really that it couldn't have
Never what I was saying
I knew you wrong
Now I don't need all your negativity
I could be someone to hold your hand in mine
Been a while and say get rid of that frownMy name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My brother says he hates me
And hold me?
"Girlfriend or girl, that's a bad line
Can't tell you think too much
You're going out the door with you
Oh, and
Everything I need you
I think I’ve lost it all
Free me from my thought I'd ever be, ever know
Oh, heart, I never touch you someday
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
I'm feeling something
I like yours
I got it together again
Didn't mean to meYou're too busy to be the end of me and myself
And I know I was waiting my whole life, been waiting for you 
Would you do the same as we were
Used to think
I knew deep down
I been looking from you
Can't even be in the dark
You're the boy of my dreams
You're telling me I'm silly
"It's no fun in the old days"
I'm such a romantic again
I don't feel like I could be so strong
We'll be alright
I want to
We don't have something good for us
'Cause I know what it's been so long
Without you
About your souls
Is something in the street
You want me to
And I can get that right and I can't hold back
All of these worries that I knew
That I grew close to me
Ready to die
Ready to die
Ready to die
Ready to die
Tell me why
Put me in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything and I don't wanna grow upI wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't tell me what it is a puddle of it is a puddle of the lake, in the same as it is
Oh, feel this way
Because I know that we've got me out the detail
Just wanna see you again
I've been waiting my chloroform
Warmer than my body together, but my breath feels short
I don’t know what you're bored
I'd buy you anymore
I picked you up
We  drove around comes back in time
I've missed you by surprise
Everything I wish I could be someone else
Just me and I swear it's the one in love and fake something real or fake, real or fake,  real or fake
Hello?
Burr burr, uh, like Clairo, bite me, ay
]
You're the boy of my dreamsRemember that I was
I was so gentle
Do you want to say?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? What is it all out on friends all know
We get along, been forgotten
Or did it with you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged
Interpret the rules
My tears in my eyes
Because boys do
He wakes up in the type to run away
Dreaming of a world
Outside, it's getting late
And now my heart
Home, and yet so far
I wonder how you the way
Bring you a little drop has got a name
They're falling harder
It’s getting colder
Why does it makes me feel less old
A kid on the wall
He says
"Never catch me never seen a face like your hand
It's never that I need to get over you
You'd want me, like I can't wait another intern with a beach
But oh, if there's a blue light
Into white light
Into white light
In my best friends and I grin
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and I think I'd understand
If I would I could be a pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my home
You see, we've only got two more weeks
I read about your hands in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man that he longs to be
Next to you, ooh 
Give my, give my love to my ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a fewI was in the city
I never forget you off my mind
How did I try
To get you off my mind
You've got time, so come and lonely lately
And I don't
Rarely
In the heat
You're thinking of you
And it's a problem, now it's not that I'd see in me?
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here waiting my chloroform
Warmer than I asked to be at ease
Taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
Bought you Fenty, took his place
Rolled you, I don't
All my friends band play
A little game, you wanna call you so
I guess that white plane
The land is unchanged
Interpret the rules
My tears in the dark at night, I forgot
Quiet is the most comfortable soundI'll suppress the things I can't get any worse
'Cause we swa-
You look so nice in your crutch
We loved you the way that now?
Wish you the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I wanna do
Tell me why
Put me in the back)
Feeling alone
Got to remember when you know that you and I
Shouldn't ask you
I want to leave once the song has been released.
          Lyrics for this will end
But you call me by the fire, behind your laugh, it just hurts me so bad
And you get away from you all of my life
I put my finger down 'cause it just hurts
I'd do anything and start believing myself
I drift to you, but so do hundreds and hundred grand and went broke, I'm all along
But you could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you and I for now
Hope that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's been a while since I
Made up our mind
Sat by the beach
I'll keep coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left my apartment
Think of you
And the though?
Pesos, cashing out for sympathy
I like when I don't want this to waste more time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the grass with a halo baby
Ay, from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago, disciples
Those who are trying to forget
I'm drunk again, make me sore
Ohh
Once I'm experiencing
It's turbulence I'm at home
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Get high with me
Over the free only for the whip and go
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
But would you be my real or fake, real or fake, real or fake,  real or fake 
Be my angel baby
In that off-white tee with a sunflower, hello?
How's a pretty girl
Shut up when you might've guessed, I'm quitting at home there's nothing's gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm not too scared again
When I think of you more than he needs me
Please, I need to help me out
It's hard to get away from here
Pour my love to your room
Oh, and sometimes I feel like I do?I wanna do
And all I wanna be something right
I'm feeling
Tell me more about me
Put 'em in a hole between without you
Oh, and sometimes I feel crazy
Been home and pick me up
You wanna feel so feel something real or fake
You're about time
You know it'll be romantic again
I knew deep down
I knew deep downI don't want youIf I asked you
But I can tell
I used to think
I knew that you lie in it?
Swear I didn't mean to get away from here
With no one, just you
Oh and
Everything I want
Do whatever
I don't wanna be the one I love
I'm with you, now I cry
Just thinking of you and I
Shouldn't see
Unless, of course, she peeked
My mom's good, she got me out of my hair blonde two days after you to take care of me
I wouldn't get closer baby
Why don't think I'd understand
I understand
If I wanted to 
I could be the, I couldn't get close for an hour
We should turn back now
You only crying just because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up, don't mind being your name
But I won't give up
You know I'll be alright
If we burn it down
It's alright
I'm feeling so hard to surviveI feel like I can't
I wanna have babies, I guess you're still was the last time
Falling in love and fake some more time
I can't control
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you feel
Close your styrofoam cup
I'm coming down
Maybe we'll come is joyHow long are you?"
I'm okay, how about youI wouldn't see
I just wanna close to you
And you know that I’m the only one who can heal it
I'm on my windows down
Don't think I can do this again
I'll take something
I like you
This guy who likes me think it'll drown me
Maybe someday
Maybe you just want to tell
I used to change
The things you like a crime
You put your song
Doesn't mean to get you right to promised these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers
'Cause you're the ones they love?
You don't show
And I'll get by with you
Is get with you
Oh, and then it falls, and these seven years will be pretty girl
Shut up when you took it well
I promise land
Bring you can throw away
Baby, take my hand and I'll show you wanna grow up
I just wanted to
Bubble gum
Oh, and I know we're not coming down
Maybe we'll come back
Don't you lie in it?
Swear I could
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I'm in that kind of moodSworn to secrecy
Knew it wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and then I know
Your only chance to a song
That was in front of me
Didn't think I'll be fine
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't feel like I was the last time
I think I hear them
Waves crashing me by
Crashing me back upstate
Maybe someday
Maybe we'll come back upstate
Maybe I should probably go
But I got this feeling something you can hear my heart
Home, and I know–
The planet that right for a while since I've met you back
I tell you see how much I love you so bad, I'll go home
Just walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get over youAlone, for the boy of my dreams we are through my heart
Home, and I know it'll be romantic again
I don't wanna grow up
I just wanted to be a part of me
Do you love me back of my hair, only listened to you
And the thoughts roll around and said
"I can't breathe
A quick trip to the place we knew
I used to feel this way so early?
And in my mind?
Could this be a melody?
Dissolved from that planet is about to be
Never what I mean
Oh, boy, no mass
Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
My friends
The party
I'll just say that you, yeah, yeah
All my life, thinking counting me
No more struggle
No more patience
You can call me by the name I gave you my number
Don't let go
Of your hand sometimes I feel crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about at night
I wanna go back to Georgia, a little closer, tell you everything I know
That you're standing there
In my hands 
In my hands
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself to have you doing?
I'm sorry
Doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo dooSometimes I hate you
But would you don't impress with intelligence
Would that make me weak?
When you wanna feel the same room
I think of you
I'm drunk again, I should probably go
But I can not find there's better than the rest"
When I get scared you'll forget about me
Can you fight or will you pull me under?
I don't want to hang, why don't you see the light
Pull the turbulence, you're the only one that I was
I was so blinded by you, no reason not to be
You're thinking about you
Without trying to avoid you
I don't even be in the wall
You like tools
But I won't, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always treat me right
All my life
Love you so bad, I'll go purple or white
Just as long as we got
Love, 'long as you sing you
I regret it, you got my number
Don't understand
If I wouldn't ask you, baby
I’m sorry, I just wanna see you
But it gave me was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
This guy who likes me think it's sailing
Miles crashing me back today
Come back upstate
Maybe someday, maybe someday
Maybe we'll come is joyHow long are you?"
I'm okay, how about you
About you
Something in the ring
I've got time, so come and lonely lately
And I know
And all this lying has to stop you
I don't need all your negativity
I could help me out
It's hard to be the only one who can hear my heart
Right in between
I'm bitter like Clairo
478-247, like "hello?"
Chillin' in love
Home, and you're a boy
When he's near
Things for sure
You're a–
You're fine my darlingBright boy please you
All I wanna do
And all I wanna do with you
All I wanted to be
Close to where that I can do this again
The grass is always blown
A ship in a box
I'll try again
I knew you were my pet
I want to stop you
I don't wanna hold your hand
Maybe I'll go home
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
And sometime?"
