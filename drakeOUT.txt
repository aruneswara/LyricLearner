The lights off, this shit move slow
I come through, ride through a McDonald's and I eat McDonald's drive through the peephole
Stomp you in Margiela’s and a peacoat
She a bum bitch, but I left some nut hangin' right beside you, could have someone...
Yeah, when you need to get it
Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard in my dunk like Vince
Moved on from them
But when I heard they came through, come through
Girl you know already
Girl, I know you heared this song
When they wasn't out to get through the 6 with my woes
You know exactly why I often get burned
But I'm just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some really nice things
But my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the girls get along with the belt on it
Fuck them cheap-ass cigars
Fuck your listening?
Walk into the booth and asked for a 16, you did it you did it
Got a dance, but she want a photo, you already know how to cook it 
My bitch in Magic, Don Juan, ugh
Man, these niggas out my businessPlease put away the year
Got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin' back to you for sure
It's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, they don't get along man, we tried it
What's the wrong answers on the mirror
My swagger is chill, and my flow is stuck in Texas like I'm new
Want me to be the only one I love
Let's go, let's go
Yeah, I got a TEC
It's roll bounce on my neck bitch
Roll bounce on my neck hurt
And no they ain't gotta drip, I can leave, I ain't have sex in a long time
Then I hit you up?" and tell my city it's on
I am a tracks demise. I will kill this snobby
I tell them about I been chosen
To deal with this shit
Other times, I question you and I
Plus I always knew that
I've been messing with Weezy I'm just play your shit plastered, nigga
I've been stackin' like them clowns 
I got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, call me when you can fuck or you can suck my wings
I'm still independent, we don't really vibe with ya man
Chill we could be this fast-paced
I never signed a 360, bitch you should fear
And the fact my mom cooped up in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in the Masi
I know I got my 23's laced
It's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
You don't have to cut the ties with the crowd went home
Only time of the most but I'm too busy flu flamming off PayPal
Arabs, you gotta lift the door
Keeping the coin in
Plus I'm changing from behind, huh
What a time to start
Just realizing a couple of your friends I'm not the other niggas' situation
Tryna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can say is you saved me
Changed all the bickerin'
And tell me, try me
All you have arrived, top five, top five, but I'm a little nervous, hit the gas and watching the Raptors organization, Raemiah, Cortne, Nicole that used to brag about it and know what is on my mind but percocets made me famous, ask my brother P-rain know, we know
My hit man named Bambino
Lingo bingo, we know, we know
My hit man named Bambino, your brain works better things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my poems
Lights low when that shit a hunna
I know you see me, that's a record
Hit the parking lot, it's lookin' moody
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, yeah
Back in the blink of an eye
I was born to get their swagger right
'Cause she heard it when you lived in a fancy house
I grew up in the crib tellin ya girl that I needed that from the projects
They kicked me out the slums
On Rodeo, but I still got it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you boys just not the seasons: one, two, drip like a fanny pack
Chasing these dirty birds
A five in a tent
Still slangin' dope in the background music at the rest of this world though, it's been happenin' lately, don't need no one else
You don't want to love you
First thing in the basement that you ain't hard, you coochie
Wally Oochie, soft as newborn booty
I say I'm serving my bitch bag
The whip came off the wine
Which is really love then nothing's gonna take some getting no money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with all that texting
Niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me when I pack
Pull the bitches tryna harm us?
And you think about it my niggas wanna rap beef with no actors
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' my name
If no one is around your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But she heard it when you think they got goin' on the intersection
Stop, nigga you could tell yo mouth to be exact
You hear that
Cause all this money got my baby she's over
I've decided to give it up
And I be getting no money but it be sounding good
You can act real wild, they don't understand nothing for things you can call to tell her friend
Heard she went back
Checks bounced but we both know why
It's too late for my cup, my drink right here on my own
So I started it right
Let a real nigga they don't make me do what I said what I spill at you, ughKD, I know you're trying to correct it
And I hate hearing stories better than me
Don't go missing, fly with me
Damn, I kept my wits about the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wanna be up in the TL, now I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'm aware that we can't tap into. That's just my way
Of saying this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit is mine had to change
Thought that it'd be so simple, but
I found a way
If you stop once and wonder why they need it much more, you know I ball without the can 
I gave it to the same, baby, then we’re touchin'
Whole four up in a one, yeah yeah
Bitch I gotta pour me a four 
I spent a fifty on the situation, you know, that's how it appear to be
You got me
You got a lot
Some of us are lost
And some gunnas that'll see me through girl you a killa but you not my wife
Why you pull up doing all the stuntin', I'll be right there
Is this interior butter

Leave your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches, too!
All I got is this money and the porch lights on and now I'm living life from both perspective
I see what you get real on a pill and I like it.

But you're not gonna trap me with you
You just sayin' you couldn't tell me, tell me
What type of act you putting in the middle then I'm not a liar
You had me down every time like 'SEND' 
I got friends now

Old black mountain

Niggas talkin' about when you say something that you prolly they ops
Hanging out the window, I'm just a little when I’m gone

Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause she bein' nice again 
Double my price again 
Top of the politics, gang

Sayin' she should be downtown
And I know you can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing, aiiight?
Yo, yo, yo. This is your chance to decide
Now it's time to give these niggas the look, the verse, and even back then
But how 'bout now, girl, where you are
I got your coat on
That runway
On this one over bitch
It’s 2020 and I got my own
Man in the city with the stockings
Hopping out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you meet my friends say
"You ain't no police in shock, don't know how it goes: don't be ride by your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shake, a brick in my hand
Blow them bands, bands
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still hood
Known to pop a lot of money but it be sounding good
You feel the same
 She want all the music
I used to whip in an accord but that's for real
Sticks in the coupe or my truck
Ain't about to crash
Trying to find a time, we been
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Seen this money intact, if you said you'd care for me, I'm about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you can take it, oh
I'm too good without it
This shit has to stop. These people recording, let's be real, nigga
Slave to the Ritz
Turned out the other nigga knew karate watch
Chop suey nigga and who ain't 'bout my paper like a how-to manual, so I guess that I'm spendin' every day
Like we sittin on the track on a rainy day in autumn
Falling from the 6Yeah, look
You know me? That's not how they treated me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
I'm double cupped right now
It's always been a gem
Certified lover man, trappin' a grammy

Why the hell of a mixture
Even though I always ride slow when I’m gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoaYeah
Never thought I had life until I check the price owing
And I fit every stereotypin' a nigga
It was the Grammy plaques just to have nothing short of great Word on road is the type to lose you
