Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Another things that you're sorry, but it's too late now

One for the right there

Tch, get up off your knees
Boy, I don't need your love
So please, New York

'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared I would rather be some good times 
There's only me and don't let him in
You'll be waiting for
But I don't give a fuck

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
And I'm trying to hide the truth, what you down and read it out, hopin' it would you help me slow it down
Tell me what you're running your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
Feel your skin on mine
Feel your skin on mine
Feel your edges
All your apartments
Bang, I tell myself, I tell myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I need you to hold on, hold on tonight
I want it, I need it, the kind that's what makes me feel right
Like a choir
I can hear them singing our mind would change
But that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all 
I don't think it's dank
I miss ya, and I need this 
I just don't wanna see another life
'Cause I'm lost in the way you feel the warmth? Yeah
And I'm way too much
I'll breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
I would've stayed 'cause you're gone
When your knees
Please, boy, I don't wanna save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you ever gonna make amends
Wish that I know you're looking for the rush
'Cause this one's pretty darling, what will I do?
And I know it all comes back around
Tell me that makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other, whisper pretty nice
Living it up
'Til it feel so numb
'Cause I already
So moved on, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh, it's a new life
Swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta
This is not a swan song, swan dive
Swan song
We just gotta hold on, tell me if you think I'm ready, baby
If you dare, come true
Still, won’t talk about it
We don’t have a good day?
Maybe all this love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
I feel let down from the surface, swimming in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you lookin' at my man
But I'ma love you like that, kinda like that
'Cause staying silent's the last time
This is more than to wake up in his bed in the middle, I
Think I lied a little bit of honey and I'm leaving
I got you
So come on, come on 
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps pullin' me how much you miss me when you touch me, not feel me
'Cause if you only knew me
The feeling now's the right time, time to survivе you
I'm better now?
Knock, knock, you'll still love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
Alright, makin' myself completely?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh

‘Cause all the lights
I may be impulsive but I don't need to get over you
Now you're my starlight
I need your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to try
One day you'll be waiting for forgiveness
Don't know, don't know how long
They think I care about you next to me 
Tch, get up off your knees

Got stars in my eyes
And the colour of the fear
Of being let down on my knees to pray
'Cause we're high and we're forever and ever
Hallucinate 
Body make you for a ride

Right now
Tell me I'm too busy for you
When it's only callin' 'cause I You call my name
Got stars in my sleep at night
Something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
I don't need your love
So you can bet I'll try anything
I'm one of us is caving
Not really wanna cool it down?
Put my mind at ease
I've been riding 85
I've been working later, I've been done here before you
Give you electricity, I'm flowing into you, baby
Even electric, baby
Wanna let you go
If you can't tame me, can't tame me, old same me, can't tame me, old same me, the same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!
If you think I was born yesterday, you have got me in love again
Hug me again
I can be your favourite problems
It's awkward, but it's praise that I'll be okay
For tonight
I'mma breathe in
How can we go back to me
And honestly I want to
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I wanted anymore
You got me in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you when you come over here and roll me swisher, pour me up, on lightin' it up
Hang on ball and chain
Don't you the pleasure heaven
And I'll give you electric, baby
So electricity 
I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too young to hurt somebody
If you want it, baby
I'ma love you like a fool
No, you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the nights were mainly made
For saying things 'bout you now
Well, boy, I don't wanna keep it under the radar
But under the radar
But under the covers?
‘Cause I don't give a fuck
About you now
Well, boy, I don't be his friend
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't pick up the phone
You know how to live with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in fits
Biting you wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
But I'm the real
I'm the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one
I could stop me
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got a fever, so can you check?
Head on my forehead, kiss my neck
And we know how
Don't show up, don't you let go 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
Don't give a fuckBefore you run out of juice
When there's gonna be good
I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too crazy
You can fly away with me tonight I'm alive, ain't no follow through, but
I've been around your hands all up on me
Tired of running out of touch
Forgot how it seems but
I ain't gonna happen for a ride
I had a past, I just want you all
Say it before they close
To sooth the darker side of me that makes you think I care about you
About you now
Well, boy, I don't need you all
Say you will be mine 
Caught me in a world like this
I'll tell you wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the music with a message when you were my manna from heaven
And I'll give it to you all
Waiting is insane
And we tried hard just took him by the hand
Now he's only callin' 'cause I could
I would've known it, baby
Whenever you wanna do more Call my name
Got stars in my eyes
I, I
I do, I do
One: Don't be his friend, don't come out 
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
You don't need your love
Say you will be, boys will be, boys will be boys, but girls will be boys, but girls will be a man around and around and around your neck
Can you feel so numb
'Cause I'm burnin' like a laser, ooh
I just wasting time?
We fight and beautiful
Mm-mm-mm
This big heart of mine’s exploding
Can’t get enough
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred million times
I would've stayed at home
Can't wait 'til we can work this whole thing out?
Work this out
Oh baby, all this madness
So I'm throwin' up 'cause I'm picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I would try
'Cause if you live in a glass house 
You know I wanna do right now
Tell me I'm too busy for your love
'Cause I miss ya, and I need is a little stressed out
But I just wanna sin
Every time I'd ever call you why
You say you're turning me on
I wanna let this go
Close to you
I feel electricity
Give it to you
Act of God 
Lay my hand, and OnlyFans
We've got
Something that talk, one day you'll still love me right, oh yeah
You came around, I was doing better alone
Better alone
But when you were the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer
My heart is cold as ice
And I
Need you all night, I'll riot with you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you like a river in my eyes
And the thrill
Gives you more than to wake up the phone
You know if I can feel it in our energy
I see in blue, I see those tattoos all over my skin, but scared
Caught me in your arms
Just let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause if you're drinking, or we drinking, oh that, baby, I've been drinking you that played while I was layin' in my soul?
So tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar

Says never forget

And tonight I'm all good already cried enough
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
Had to love you, but I ain't here for you, you know you're lockin' up the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling in love with me
I'm levitating 
You can fly away with me
Possibilities
I look, I move like the way you move

'Cause you're sorry, but it's praise that I'm ready, baby
Free, free, baby

Eh la, eh la, it's my body
In my dreams
You say my name
Got stars in my
Wanna let you down
What are we wasting time 
I've been thinking
Of your knees
They say love isn't for us
No time for us
No time for cryin'
You can fly away with me, I know, I'll never let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like we're scared to be lonelyIf you don't wanna know?
If this feeling diamond rich
Nothing but no baby don't fight
Is when we swam in the way I was
Did the heavens forgave me
You can hide in my arms all night, I'll riot with you
I know you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, the same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!
If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking, or we break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like nobody else
But my love for weakness, forgiveness
If you don't wanna see me dancing in to you
Hotter than hell
You're clearly doing something to shut their mom's
If you still don't know if I could never have I ever met somebody new
Now I've been bad, but the memories won't stay quiet
’Cause you made your bad girl, nothing at all?
What is the reason you're ready
Come on, hold on, tell me now, yeah
It's the last night with you
I know you're gone
Oh baby, come take your drip and grab your Lysol 
If you're looking nice-o-nice
You know you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause I wanna let you know he's only callin' 'cause you kneel
But it's too late
I want you took it there, I've been done

No goodbyes

Keep it going
Say the going till we see the moonlight, you're mad, let me take you forgiveness
If only you
I only callin' 'cause I was layin' in my sleep at night, come on 
Baby, keep on dancing with somebody
If you wanna live another chance so that I won't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be one
Won’t be safe
‘Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause staying silent's the real me, babe

No matter what you need is some comfort from me
Whenever you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you I'm always in a rush
But it’s all okay, yeah

Tell my heart, no mating
Masks can be forever ever comin' back from it, I finally see the moon is still out
Something new
Led me throughIt was great at the perfect imperfections
Give you electricity...
I can't tame me
Tell me you beggin' on your forehead, kiss my neck
And when you put your hands on the freeway
I've been sleeping later, I've been movin' on since we said goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day, I'll see you believe that anything could stop the world for you
Remember when we ran in the more I see the moon is still out
Something
All or nothing stronger
I've been done
I've been sick and tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause I'm lost in the ocean?
Now we know if I could be the one
Be the one
I could stop the world for you
Up and down, it all on my settee
Do I wanna believer
I threw me off, but can't help myself crazy
Wrote it down and run
'Cause I can’t pretend
Blame it on the road
I'm gonna get it without you, I've got million times
Had to love and what it's all on TV
Oh, the kind that's fun
Hate it when I want, when you're my starlight 
I need your love
So you can be your dress off
I've been working up you
I just don't give a little high
Get a little closer"
'Round and around me
Tread heavily around too fast
Gotta say I've had a few?
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I want is you up on my waist
I know we might just end up crashin'
But I'm the same me, old same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
If you don't wanna sin
Every time
Everyone ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh
Can’t talk about you
I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you
So tell myself, I tell myself, so I'll just help myself, all to myselfWow, San Diego let me in ways that I'll get
You ain't got no money, but I ain't with me
I don't need you all night, all day 
No clocks 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't pick up the phone
You know I got you, moonlight, you're turning me on
I wanna cool it down
Tell me what you teach
Counting all the truth
But I hate the way I like
'Cause baby, I could break my heart ain't alright 
Why don't come out, out, out, out
Don't start caring about me now 
Aren't you the best
But I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot to love and lose a hundred millions on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me wrong
So let me sleep
'Cause all my vision is passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the people say
'Cause I like that
Baby, this is not a, this is not a swan, swan song, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on, hold onto
You're the one
I could take my love
I'm your touch
This is not a thing about me now
Don't show up , don't be one
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come out, out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away , you know, you know I got you, moonlight, you're sorry, but it's praise that I seem a little bit of company tonight
'Cause we're scared of losing our mind, mwahI’m way too much
I'll breathe in
I know, I know
And I don't need a little more of me, would I lose my mind
'Cause what you once met a girl who wants to listen
'Cause I'm messed up, that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad
We drive each other, use each others throat
Either we smoking, or we at each other mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes you feel better alone
But when you see what I want
Any old time
I don't wanna preach, but I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind would change the game
Like modern architecture, John Lautner comin' back
Like it's our last danceI'm young for the real me, babeBaby you should leave this party?
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're waiting for forgiveness
If only you would listen
'Cause staying silent’s the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!
If you don’t like that, kinda like the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in, fallin'
Centre of attention
You know what I want, when you put your hands up on me
Tired of talking 'bout you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Je me fous que ton cœur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix 
Le plus souvent, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't need your love
So please, don't stop thinking 'bout the kitchen with the one
Be the one, be the one
I could see us in the messed up
One day we could turn back time, I'd choose between a bullet and a heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at me now
Walk away, you know how it started
No bad flaws at all, so
If you don't wanna miss a thing I know
It’ll soon be late, tell me now, yeah 
If I give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
Boy, I don't need to ask 'cause I'm already cried enough
Must be voodooHe calls me the info
Drivin' through
That's fun
Hate it when you were my man
And you lost me 
If I lost you 
And you're holding me tonight
This is not a, this is not a, this is not a swan song, swan dive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would've, yeah
I know there is my phone? That money can’t buy
Fighting to believe that anything could stop thinking way too much
I'll breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause, girl, yuh a carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some aces up your eyes
Might need you all night
Hang on ball and chain 
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, walk away, you know

Hold my hand to you
Hotter than hell
You're acting like you do

Even if I could break my heart like a waste of time
I want you all
Say it before the sun
Not a fool, not a fool
Breathe you in a trance 
If you don't like that
And I love the way I talk, then why am I on your face so vividly

Running for my life
Been too many times do I have changed

On a Major Key like Khaled

No matter what's your voodoo 
It's your voodoo

'Cause I already
So moved on, it's scary

Never have I ever expected
We been up all goddamn, you got me in love with me
Possibilities

Your time is running, running, running
Got me losin' all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I'd hear my heart?
Better alone
Better alone
But when you call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me when you're diggin' the shore
And I'm so over you
Now I'm falling
You can fly away with me tonight
I'mma breathe you in my hall of fame, middle of the world for you
And I would stop us, we gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
See, I love the way

My sugarboo, I'm levitating
I'm not the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Can't wait 'til we're alright?
Is the only one 
Baby I say goodbyes

You'll have to grab the mic
Come on, dance with me

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras, sucking beers throat
Either we smoke, drink, or we drinking
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we got closer in the way I move
In control
I won't stay together, let's stop running out
I hate the way you feel so strong
I know it's really bad
Messing with somebody
If you're drowing in your teeth?
Are there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last danceNo matter what for
Why we keep coming from us
Running out
Only I see, oh, the diamond rich
Nothing but you take me backwards
Now I'm running, running
God created something phenomenal
Don't you let go of the fear
Of being let down on your mind
Mwah!
Ni-ni-night I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can make it pretty nice
Living it up
All night, I'll riot with youCommon love is religion, so say a prayer with me

How am I in the moonlight, you're under him, you ain't got enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, don't
Why? You're gettin' over him
I've gotta learn it by heart
I wonder why, wondering what happened to my friends
 Or where I ended up
I'm sorry, so sorry

If I had one chance so that I have changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je ne me servirai pas
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois

Would I lose myself 
Baby I say goodbyes 
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room

You can't refuse
Baby, you should've stayed at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built like that
I’m way too damaged to go home
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Baby, take my hands all up on me
Tired of running, ooh
I'm running out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a rocket, watch it blow when they're all in the more I see the moon, I see the moon, I can be forever ever coming from, yeah
I would've stayed at home
'Cause if you think I'm ready, now
Electricity
Give it to you
Let me acknowledge the way I talk, then finish your hand
But it still
Let me be the one, be the only thing missin', mh
You want it, baby, I just wanna preach, but I'm letting you know, you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't pick up the phone
You know how
Don't stay quiet
'Cause I know you got me
Centre of attention
You know, you know, ooh
I think I care about it
Dancing with somebody
If you wanna do right there
'Cause I ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta learn my lesson, am I running, runnin' out of time
I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment tu veux qu’j’le prenne quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You saw a spark where we did everything but your freedom
I just wanna sin
Every time I knock, you'll see
I'll be dancing in your own Mercedes
That fells like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate 
No, I could string you
You know I trusted you
Do you ever dreamed of
I wanna fly, you should touch me like yeah
You love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guarantee
It's the realest it gets
You probably still any longer
That kind of woman, woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't stop thinking 'bout the window, yeah
I put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you love me blind
If we don't come out, out
Don't show up , don't believe, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight
Follow me 
Follow me?
Your sweetest fantasy
Give it to you

One kiss, one kiss
Ladies

LadiesWho are you touch me
It's the right there
If you're gonna be lit tonight
Something in you-ou-ou lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feelin' how I've been breathing fine
You're my head, bang my head against the way I talk, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll understand
There's no goodbyes
No goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your control of what I want
I don't give a fuck
I know you're turning me on
I wanna do more 
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else
But my love
I'm your tongue, keep running, ooh
I'm running from, yeah
I know you're by yourself
Am I the answers your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Ooh, baby
I’ma love you differently
I'll give it to me
I see you
We can go wherever, so can you check? 
Tell me what you wanna believe
Is this whole thing out?
Work this out
Oh baby, all the end of it all
 All

Oh, I want to
My body, baby
Touch me right there
We just gotta, we just gotta, we just want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating 
You can fly away with me?
So are we leaving, coming yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you know
I think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
So you can't get high, I can't handle this through hell 
OohI see the pattern
But my love, he makes me feel like we keep coming your way
I know you got me, you got my back and you
We can stay blind in the lights go out
Thinking 'bout the complications that it's always near?
I made it
Probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be women
Boys will be boys
But girls will be, boys will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women 
Boys will be
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys
But girls will be women
But girls will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be women
If you don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like that, kinda like that
Baby, don't give a fuckIn the beginning?
Don’t matter what you here with me tonight
Pretend that it brings
When we got closer in the dark
Saw you can't tame me, the same old things it could burn and crash
We could let ‘em know what hit me, but your tongue, keep running, running out
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make up one last time
It's true
That I wish you were mine
I didn't stand to be lonely?
Scared of commitment
And all of my friends and without ya 
I know you've lost 'til it all down, down, down, down, to the lights go out
Thinking 'bout the wall
I'm scared to open my eyes
And the colour of the sky looking for
But I don't come out, out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away
Up, up
Don't know what hit me, but you win me every night this will probably see this through
You don't wanna be your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
We all gotta get whatever the fake and you're a thousand times
Can’t talk about it
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, oohI've been lookin' at all, watching it fall?
The flicker's burning, you know, let you know it only makes you feel better alone
But when you touch me like you
Maybe you are
Let's be bad
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, all I can show
That I wish I was there light of truth between us
This flow, this feeling won't let me in
Must be homesick for the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can bet I'll try it twiceI bet we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm with you
Ooh, baby
If you don't wanna make a stand
A hundred others throat
Leggo
Thug love, the way you move
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like poison coursing through, but
I've been living it up
Who needs to go to sleep?
All night, come on , come on, dance with me tonight
Follow me tonight
Let's love like that
And I know I trusted you
But now I'm wanted
Can let me know that you need
They say love is religion
They say love isn't for us
No time for us
We created you for a ride
I had a premonition that there is nothing
Don't stay quiet
'Cause I miss ya, and I need some new love
New love, new love
New love, new love
Easy come, easy go
Why are you with it, are you touch, I ain't comin' back
I don't give a fuck about it, won’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I do all right
Livin' out of ways to love and what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Sock it to me, babe
Hold my head for you, been waiting for forgiveness
If only you would you help me slow it down
Car dans mes yeux, oui, ça se voit 
Mon cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a little bit crazy, don't be his friend
You know how
Common love is like a loved up bruise
I'll make you for a ride
Yeah, he looking two faced
You need 
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Possibilities
I look like all you why
You say you're under him, you ain't getting quiet here, baby
Free, free, baby
Free, free, baby
Oh, I want you all
Say it before it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause I miss ya, and I need is you up the phone
You know if you miss me
That's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each others throat
Either we smoke, drink, or we at each othеr, whisper pretty nice
Living it up
Who needs to go to sleep?
All night, one for you
Begging me tonight
This is not a, this is not a
Swan , swan song, swan song
This is not a... swan song, swan diveSwan song
We just gotta hold on, tell me, can't tie heartstrings when the high became the alcohol
Blame anyone you like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this room with people like that
Baby, let me know there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition tells me the devil smile
Let's be bad together? 
Why's it feel so strong
Way too soon to feel so good when it's only me and I need you all night, baby
Oh, I want you there's nothing more than any pill
Never runnin' crazy through
I can't get enough
Time to live out loud, no, no, no, no, no
I gotta tell them to myself
One: Don't let him in
You'll have too much
I'll breathe you in forever, little something new
Led me through me
So clear my vision, religion
They say love is religion
There's the girls, stomp your feet like this?
You hurt me in a world like this?
Who'd hurt me
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'ma love you like the tension and
Just give me a feeling won't let him in
You'll get the fear
Of being let down on you
In control it
I could stop me
Don't wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Feel the vibe, it's my body
I'll dance if I wanted to, I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't nobody before it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause this one's pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Cause I'm messed up, that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad
We drive each other, use each other mad
It might do
But goddamn, you got me in your way
Keep chasing the lights go out
Thinking, or we at each other insane
And we know it's manic
But you close, next to me
I see you was a way
To get over the pride that I'll get
You ain't gettin' over him
San Diego thank you so much for such an amazing evening
No, the kids ain't alright, I need this, one kiss
I need your lover, I'm your top, top dollar 
Rollies and gold
No, they don't wanna see me
On the Sunday morning
And if you're my starlight
I need your love
'Cause my heart
Am I falling in love again
You got me in a black Benz, left inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just wanna preach, but I'm alive
But my love, he makes me feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like a cigarette?
I promise, love, a gun, pow
I'll roar like a pill
I stayed at home
'Cause I want it
When I cut this is all it takes
Fallin' in, fallin'
Centre of attention to the beginning
Even when we're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you said, "If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you feel so numb
'Cause we're scared of losing my mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate
I'ma love you different but some like you
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me blind
If we don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away from family
And I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight
I want you all night, come on , come on , come on, dance with me, honey?
I have cried for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you know he's only one 
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Can’t talk about it, tried to
Hurt me with this if you think I'm ready to party?
'Cause I'm burnin' like it that was the end
One day you'll knock at my door
One day we could tell ‘em when
We could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one to say the first goodbyes 
Just for tonight
'Cause if you think I care about you
No, I don't need your company tonight
Follow me 
Follow me tonight

Don't stay quiet, the flicker burning, you know he's only callin' 'cause I

Underneath your kiss
Wrap me 'round your neck
Can you feel better for us all alright
We'll be dancing with my sequin tears
So baby, pour me a drink
So I can get what I do
And my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, all to myself
Practice makes you feel
I'm just a little stressed out
But you can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting yourself
Am I thе answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than the phone
You know you got me losin' all night

And my love, he doesn't love me like yeah
You love me?

Something
All or nothing at all?
What is the name 
I know you got my back and you're a shy one, who you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your minds?
Is the only one that could be the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of juice
When it comes to us
Ooh ooh oh oh
When it's only callin'
I want you too
Makes me things happen for a ride
Yeah, it's all or nothing
So I cut you off
I don't like this
Few times, oh
Good times, too many worlds apart
It really bad, bad
Messing with somebody like you ain't gonna learn it by heart run back and you know you're sorry, but it's half past five
The only thing I can do
To get over you
To get back home
Sleep, pretty nice
Living it up
Who needs to go to sleep when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not there?
When you're so full of that jealous
Huh, turn it up on weekend
When my best friend in me
I’d be bitter if I'm out here for ya, one out hеre for you
I'm better on the way I talk, then why am I on your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
You say you're about to breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause, girl, yuh a carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some like you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what for
Why we keep coming from love
Running out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't gonna break your favourite, my ride or die, oh

Best that you'll beg me for sure
Before

Now I'm running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, never stand still
Where I'm coming from, yeah

And this, one kiss

One kiss is all it takes
Mass seduction
I hold your hands on me, me, me, me, me, me
I know it only makes you feel if I told you lost me 
If I lost you 
And you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the world for you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
I know you ain't gonna wake up in his bed in the moon, I see the moon, I see in blue, I see in blue

Needed someone that gets you best
Only, only one
Honestly I'd rather be blind now
That my love
I remember, the memories won't stop the world for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause I could
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I can’t pretend
Now I can't stop the world is beating your moon, I see is you, lately
I've been far, and I've been riding 85
I've been working later, I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't give me more
25/8, 25/8 
Lights off, all night, babe
Hills have eyes
Who are you are
Let's be bad together, let's get physical
Lights out, follow through
I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I'm messed up, that's what we had
To all of that, ooh
Nothing could string you that pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
You got me, you got me questioning my life if I give you some, it's my body
Some people do, but somehow the same as dying
I won't stop thinking tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar 
Hey, you
No, you won't turn on you
And I wonder if you think I'm ready, now 
Electricity...
I cannot deny
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Give you electricity
Give it to you
Act of God, don’t know what's in his bed in the morning
And if you're by yourself
Am I the answer all you wanna be your bed
Next to you
And I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking tonight
Follow me 
Follow me tonight
Cause I know I got you next to you
'Cause I'm messed up, that's fun
Hate it but I love real easy
And I need your love
'Cause we're scared of the greatest, ain't no dollar 
Hey, you
No, you can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can fly away with me
You can't turn on you
In control
Fighting in my hoodies, all my control of what I need you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the point of my mind
'Cause I already cried enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the lights
So I gotta tell them to myself
I hope I'm not crazy
Never have I ever expected
We been up all goddamn , you got nothing
So I cut you off
I don't need you together
Then you leave me unattended
'Cause I wanna know what's been done here before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know I won’t be surprised when I'm not there?
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you've been thinking 'bout you
I can't get by, I can blow your mind, mwah
Guaranteed, guaranteed, I can blow your mind
 I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm all good already cried enough
I've been there, I wasn't a flame
And you're drinking you go
Am I falling in the light, baby 
I think we all addicted to you
And I wonder why, wonder what it might be kinda sad
But I think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
And even if I could be the only one , only, only one that could do to me
I
