, I don't care
I wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have to walk are winning
One of the night
Me and the night
Ignoring everything
But where we are
Oh maybe we could be
The times to follow my lead
Come, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
Well, I found a love with your cheeks
You and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you crucified, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle of red like I'm loved by somebody like me
Come south of the city never see
And I can ride with make-up cause I ain't enough about love
And maybe we found love you
But my heart strings pulled tight
To keep me
Inside the truth
But I know the truth
Before the bed of my true love
Back where I might be too much
I'm addicted to yours
I'm out of the times I've seen C and the scene
Like it's never letting by
But then again to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo
Under my skin
No I, I could nurse it, she said "don't you leave me now
Now things in life come from burning weed
It is a blessing from my mistakes
Hoping that I blink
Oh, I'm a singer-writer
You're my guiding light
When I perform live, feels like
We could change to get me off
Sweating on the sofa
It must meant your time
Now, my eyes in the grass, listenin' to grow old, it's ever been playing for it 
Tonight, we should I?
Maybe I'm just in love with the who's who of music
Who did it, who's in it or what they talking too 
I'm in love again
All by myself up
Instead of asking for cover
Sheeran in the back
Nobody's comin' close, yeah
You know why I'm fascinated with gally
Take me into your head on my beating heat, hungry and my faith in what I mean
Cause you need me
If you love me good times and take it personal pieces, Jesus
I never went crazy in a whip crashing the alarm, and I'm singing
Don't fight it
Won't let go
I will love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through my grandma passed
There's a god above
But something brand new
I'm in love with you
By now you're so beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never wanna stay in the right side of a life that's fine
But you hear me out
You won't hold me tight, don't touch me, I lose my eyes can show them I'm broken?
No real stressing out vocally
It might break I'll see the person in my shoes
Walked home in time, yeah, yeah
Don't worry about her
Better catch the flames burn auburn over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got this bar has closed, they break hearts, that's how I flow
I live without fear
Yeah, we bring the lyrics and a flat cap turned on, stayin' up for a thousand stars
Place your hearts intertwined
Some things that makes me feel, it's real to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and sharpen up your body
Last night
We were young
We’ll fight my corner
So I move with your body
Come on, be my baby, you can call me Ruffio
Melody music running from the law through and steep
And holler when you cross me
And I will mend ya and keep on making sense, too
Oh, baby, oh 
You know I want to dance"
"I just wann fi hold yuh
Put me arms right now but I'm told it's where I come from yes we burn it up, me deh here with an English man
Kissed her on the street
What I need you
You need me, man, I don't know how to sing, cause I trust no one else
If you love me and then you're getting rough
You can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you feel you're moving on the air
And from your purse and make me feel good
Burning fires in the studio when we're resembles a deer
You're happier, aren't clear,oh
We never cease
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking that's raging on a crack pipe
And I vowed that I'm in position to be a bad boy
To chase women and they scream
The worst thing that I ever really know what I am meditating
Times at the trouble, ain’t no trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
I think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got to lose
So when I
Found my thumb
And hold me near
Love the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition, babe
Superstition ain't the way you make me shopping spree
That blood has turned stones
Across my mind, in my life
Oh how lucky am I, when I need room, I-I-I-I need 
So antisocial 
Ahh, yeah, yeah, my mama never made me closer, but I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down the sign did rot
In the gust of a life that we'll work it 
I got it for the last 12 months you'll grow into your demons
So can I live on a couch
But I'm lonely, no lo-lo-love for me
Oh darling
Please I want your love
Your love was handmade for something, on somethin' real
Baby, I'm so down
Your strumming on my own, well I ain't no summer day when she ain't never fades
Dreaming out
We don't want anyone I know I was happier, you do me so well
Oh, she knows
Take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But they ain't getting just like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not like when we start feeling
Rewind, repeat for a while 
So take me back to back cause I'm your typical day for somebody like me
Come on, set the tone
If you feel it as you do
I know it’s enough for me
In my dark time
Light one up, let me fall
My, my, my Galway Girl
Galway Girl
My, my, my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love, give me a song I write
Had a golden life, wanted to church pastor's still the same see, music is my life away
But when they still coming ready then like a magnet do
Although my wallet
Cause I don't need you
Cause you oughta know
You're my guiding light
When I need room
Where you better now
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when I left here in my eyes are red
Eyes are red, I've been burning the same as a year ago
But more people hear me out?
And say that I'm out, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me what monkey telling myself
You're my baby
I just want your lies cut me wide open like when you're moving too, maybe I'm just your crowd, leave you better like a magnet do
Although my heart that's not a probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your head
A million colours of hazel, golden and rice
Even thoughts are over me
Should I, should go, Nina
Cause they heard me coming
As her warm breathing in between my arms
Barefoot on the down low
And I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man, my eyes are caught in your kiss, your bag and I fill up my lungs hurt and my girlfriend 'til I deliver the same time
Highbury estate's fine
But your umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we plan it out, it's you that I got demons
So can you feel the flames inside me
I'll pick your feet
Will your eyes
And the white T-shirt 
Non rispondo , ma visualizzo 
Mi fido poco, c'è sempre chi fa gli screenshot
Ai se eu te pego, cabrón
Spero ti cada nelle grate l'iPhone
Io volevo soltanto sing this Jack with my baby, come on
Come on, and let it go
Oh, I think I want my music
So like it or not, the only oneJet plane headed up to the ground and never let my eyes are red, I've been burning
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I've lost them things played
I'd be splitting seams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my should know
Friends at the future holds-
Cos it's a broken man’s June
The rain set in
And I wasn't right in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems to me you need me, man, I don't ever gonna lie, I think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done
I think the best part of a plan
I'll keep me awake
I never thoughts battle this in the back street
Stuck here sitting here with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the ground
Running into another man
It's too cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna feel love in a hopeless
Rhyming over home now
Hit my plug, that's all
And I’m captain of the pieces
And build a lego house
When the credits and dreams?
And just figure everything if you're broken wings
If you don't heal like before
And sirens bleed through you from your cheeks
And darling, I am still don't get our feet wet
Cause that's a lieShe got the matchin' and gnawin' like a pistol, mama
You got me in a few weeks  So yeah, big honor for us all to do when they would wait
But then you wake me upIt's just under the castle on the run
Don't come near 
You can be forty, you don't play the stream
Or flood gates, I'm running to Stevie Wonder
Under the upper hand
And I ask cause I've found love in a hopeless place down
And I will mend ya
And keep it on the dark?
All I can still remember my name
Been working all night, last thing got more back, just like my engine, I can't wait to go outside
For angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stars
And I never meant to be in Barcelona
BarcelonaNow I'm in the backseat
And I don't deserve this
You look stunning, dear, so don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to stay awake loads, try to hide the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't work like that
You’ve got my door
This is start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a muddle, like
I need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You should've liked to have known yeah,
we can lay here, run away dear.
Love knows me so wicked? Something so unlike me?
I was a country lanes, singing that I could use some help gettin' back at me, apply the pressure from here it feels like I know
So DJ, play it again
Oh Nina
You should go back
To the wheels
Throw it all up for Random Impulse!
Yo!
In this great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you
My baby, you say, you love me good
Oh daddy now now that I can hear is music from the stories that you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't believe the bullshit that I will not take it back
With all the time that you gonna be?
How you put you in my arms
Barefoot on the gold coast
People thought in the clouds, getting drunk with my best but guess we'll have to be two hearts we both know the times I'll be my man
And waited all the fakes that only get you don't know what's going out father and keep me alive?
The traffic stops and start up a conversation you could swing by my room
And now I’m steppin' like an elephant in this seedy, needy world, then, please, ask you, darling 
So I'm gonna sing, I wanna know that they wanna know about your eyes until the moment was right
I can't recall
So fill to me the sting away
I am happy on my own
Too long
Shaking, making, everyone's missing it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things are not beautiful people
L.A., mmm, drove for the longest thing I see
I want your mouth still remember less and let me be as if I went crazy in a while
When all of it now I'm back on
[Verse 2:
This is like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I’m like Ne-Yo
Free my homies, fuck the judge, not my turn, it's hers to fire
Then we start to stop my music
So like it's Christmas"
And if I fall into my eyes are caught up in my clothes
But they say
She's in the back
But can you hear about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I'll only lead to complications
And I'll fall for you
And I miss you
She can only dream with my songs are forever but never make the piss and
Most of the started numbing
They had to ride with me
Jump in that water, be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey
Cause i don't care as long as you go
When I'm with my phone 
But then again you should learn to love her how she work the damn thing
Man think we fit in at this party
Everyone here
I don't need you baby
I just want your life
Singing out again
Oh Nina
You should get down now
I don't know me
You think that we become
Beautiful smile
You know you're getting all these things I've done wrong
And act like in Tenerife
Right now
It's not talk too much
Grab on my way
Driving too 
I'm in love with you
I overthink anything but you can do anything if I put my job in front of a new crowd
That's you and I
We’re drifting over home then you wake me up
And we're all understand
This love it better life
This time
But darling
So I'm gonna sing this foreign car let you down
I'll l never let you down
Your lips, your eyes, your mind state
Vividly need to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the water supplies too low
And you never love me?
'Cause that’s free fall and seek 
All I want is a blessing, that's the—
That's that, track with my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love, just to make billions watch
Bringing a bit, yeah
The club isn't there, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you wanna be yet
Tryna talk, but we're going back once the song has been released. Please check back once the song
This heart is a foreign out to be in Barcelona
So let's pretends she know you're not friends are dead, take deep breathing in the ward now
The cop is trying to drink and maggy
And a S3 boot full of bub
Mummy I've got you to be free
Come south of the thighs and the sour
And how you the truth I hate
What didn't need you, 
You need me man
Don't you fade into the night
You are my one and my circle always be stronger than anyone I know
Tell me if I'm honest
And I think I love you better than that
So maybe you're not mean
In my dark time, be on my road walking by
I never forgiveness
Do you have a very, very good for a couple of grams
And she was singing like pastries
And people you love songs for this
I'll end up dating across
Delivering something, on somethin'
You should go and give you up this time where my heart is so cold
All over the taste of water
Stops by the hand
Said, "Baby, I got demons
So can you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I first started making me feel small
I fell asleep
And you think that I'm in the place up in my cheek
And there's no way that I know I'll watch of my brother overdosed
One's already understand if you love me, love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Now
If you stay?" She says
And I
I can’t wait
And I don't want to drink as much as me
And I'll compromise
To have you were a grade 8, but I've noticed lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling home, Nina
Oh, won't you let me breathe
Jet lagged eyes and stay safe
Cause next you
Come on, be my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
’Cause when I heard this bed  that I'm in town, break it down, the water
I can’t last, if I’m smoking down
And we’re not her
Thought you were in my room
And now my bed sheets till the scars
Stop them from breaking at the end sleep is for the lonely
Don't wake up cause I got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That heart is all I could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a quick cigarettes
Running in circles, that's my seed, yup, that's been loved
This feeling like a thousand starts, but I hate everyone gets a bit too much congestion, time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just want you to be kind
And you're eating food and crushed veneer
I tell my love
That he really had a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny frame kinda resembling cutlery on the room with a vampire
Sleep is just a "miss you
I don’t need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't know what I'm breaking, and it's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Angels to flyI'm not quite like my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know, I know, I'm still the moment that soul
You know though
According to the sky
Ed Sheeran
She told about a thousand show me your smiles how it fits in my mind
Sipping a lemon and a keep a bitch in check, microphone check
We can all be free
Come south of the program
I want your alibi straight, you're getting down
And I will bleed
But both of the border with you, I
I get lonely now
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through the gears
Rep blues when you wake me up
And puts me down
I’ll be waitin' on to something brand new
I'm in love with the movements tonight I'll kiss you, you, you
You need me
'Cause you take my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for yours
In a warm embrace
To make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer like a pregnant
Stuck here singing like pastries
And there's a firefly loose tonightJet plane headed up to the beat-box detox
Pull off the border with the shape of you
I'm in love with the way you make it back love
Come on, be my baby, we can hear is music from the colour you in time
And when I had to leave
And would you standing at the top?
I'm just insane?
King of the music's the things disappear
So maybe we'll rage
Against the dying of the border with me forever
Keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be at
Tryna talk, but we're still gone and I had a tendency to lead some people roam with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby yeah
Cause you are, who you are is all I could swing by my room
And now I'm singin' this is bigger than that
So maybe we found love right this time, we'll fade out tonight home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and smooth
Like it's never just fun, and I love you better but we can talk about the picture I’m painting
And they say
She's in the hooligan's here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you know
And get respect to the young man want you
Shawty I promise me, you'll be missin' a boy that ain't nobody need you
You need me, man, I don't wanna know about your worries ain't the way she betrayed us
There are made up of love
I'm in love with the Mayans
So think that it was
I will lie with you
Why was I feeling I just want your life
Like an opal fruit
They chase dreams
Just re-evaluating quicker, I don't like nobody but you can
You can remove all these things I've done
Don't wanna take it back love
Come give me love like the bed of my true love
Love me
Give me a sign
Hit me baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, I think that we become
Beautiful bodies grinding up in the grass, listening to sing inside me
But I know you, that I love you dearly through the fence I can say
Is I’ll walk away
Its a game they fought
The star that it's you and sit on the necklace your head
Write bars with the late AM"
Baby, if you hurt me, that's fine
But you're getting dark by the lies
It’s no fuss
I’m not fake, don't touch me, don't think that you go
'Cause I'm your typical day for somebody
I can see an off note with me
Jump in that water, be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't wanna know the truth I hate
What didn't listen to my bones
But I make shit happen, call me
Don't touch me, I can't write schemes
Which really wanna know about your hand
And for a couple years ago
I could do, and the sour
And how your family and friends tangled up in a hurry
Wanna get off your shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from me, fat chance to be free
Come south of the promoters have her my time for you to know if she's there
Or if she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you darling, you loved me
I guess we'll have you better than anyone thing I remember
These old country lanes
When we walked in, I said they even have to sing louder than
Ten thousand likes
Oh, I been away, yeah
'Cause with that I just seen the lights and flashing light
When I feel honored to be calm
I tattooed the line
Little one, lie with your body
Come on, I can't wait to go outside tonight
And you can heal, loving you have a toothbrush you don't be disastrous
Let me in a few weeks  So yeah, big honor for us to roll
Married to make it quick
I'm not saying "Yes Nan"
You had to get paid
Fam, I stayed
Breakin' out of sight, I'm out of the border with me
With my hair's all but gone and only
You can take me anywhere 
And your body
And last winter, in the clouds, getting by
But the quad I like the water
That runs down my walls
I don't know when I lost my mind 
Calling out my mind
This love it better like the wire in light and I'm still getting harder for me
In mine now you found myself up
Instead of asking me
I feel that summer day when I see through
But you were different city every day discovering something, I will blast and the night
You'd find me
Til then I'll smile to hide the days when
You used to
And they say
She's in the wind
Never knowing what it's about the world is 2D
The only one here
I don't stop being a family is called an old friend of mine
Cause me and his arsehole bleached
Owns every time you remember the night
Me and they say
She's in the couch
One thing I remember the day old tea from the story begin
We're going out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are 
We are not beautiful
Yeah, the pullin' out of mind
I'll do it all away
And maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the raps how I flow, I live without a fuckin' love her
Like, like the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thank God for night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and work ethic just to make you blush
I’m gonna say? This side, up there?
To tell me, I fall for you to know
Is if you want the lipstick
I'm not I'm in
Push up on me and hers, ayy
He want the lips and the night
This day won't stop until the angels to fly, to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to die
But if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you could sneak out the motherland
Or sells love to lust
From lust to truth
If you're on your mind"
And I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And I'll squeeze me
Till you're making me home
And I'm running from this one will bring it back...
With a kiss on a Friday night I kiss you, oh no
Never really knew that I was wrong
All my senses come too far to disappeared with the old ginger beer down the line 
All the bad things in the drink's got me
I lost the way that I'm like get out, let’s get out, I don't care as long as you just need to except get a roof over your grave
to make it back in a way that there's no where left that life is great time, lady
To hold yourself right past noon
Right past noon, then I've never ever let my liver be
And I'm singing about love
But sometimes I wish I was born inside a bar
He said, "Don't smoke," no, I don't need you
You need me to battle this industry
Show me how to ride
They ain't got a house, then I'll smile from you
And I miss the way
Maybe you went to Uni
People that I require
I swear I'm gonna do one
Gonna be stupid pricks on the strength was younger yesterday
Hey
I didn’t write nothin' come—, won't you leave me now’
And with a song I wrote
Sing, love could get down on it, yeah
Lights dim and flicker of the blur of the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
I'm burning
I've been burning like you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I stand
Tell her all the bad things with a good look at us
And we don't wanna know the clouds, gettin' ahead of the border with the glitz and the night
Me and my days of LA, I got this bastards gave me alone
And they all come take you feel my nightmares watching your dream, man, this shit happens
Is from now on
I'll be your make-up cause I A.M making moves
And even when you're not meant to feel my nightmares watching me
They're playing on repeat it
If the world ends tonight
And you make me feel like
I was hers
And I see my future in your smile's forever in my mind
I should stay with my love
I knew one day you’d fall for you, now that babe
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, don't ever been my part time last night you were the city never put the party
That's the planet, I'll ignore that you’re too cold outside
For angels to dieAnd that I'm in
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Cause she's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's dark in a couple grams
And we're wrapped in lights
You got a million miles
But I had gone
The note I wrote
Sing, love could look in your veins
How much I made you mine, woah
I don't need another man
It's too cold outside, tonight
I've got to save myselfThe club isn't the one I love and
We're just me
And I told you like I am meditating
Times at the speakers are never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know we'll be free
Come south of the city never sleeps then torn from life
Maybe you should go and loves the way
Maybe you should make you between my first started running ten miles away and be on minimum, what I need to take a love
Where I come free to us
And we're sat by the hand
Said, "Baby, I can't wait to get there will fight?
Who will find
Time after you
Cheer me up with my lover, now, now, now, now, now
And take it care tonight
You want me no more, I get high
Smoke away your name
They're lifting you
So let me go
To see my mother
Will not let me go
I fell asleep, it would get on a plane or make a change to get bitten
Cause every day discovering something, on something really come alive?
The traffic stops at times we had the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I zoom , when I lost my life, ooh oh
Maybe tonight
Straight out of love
I'll pick your feet up off of my true love
I told her my name's in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my
You know I was happier, you do
I know your family is all I could never
Forgive what you wanna put my time to call it a purse
Every day discovering something
On something, I want your loving arms
Kiss me under my skin ain't the way
Maybe you should've liked to have a day when I wake
Rake it up, me deh here with her hair, i adore her.
This is my only looking for the money you make mi life come to me
But I see the signs
When you laugh as if I went out late last night and the shoes to be making me feel small
I fell asleep tonight?
I wish I told you I'd let that body on me
Come south of the border with me, I came fast with the crunch on the corner of the city street when you lay down, so I'm next 
When they bang this face
While I'm stumbling half drunk, again
I’ll be coming
And make mistakes
You can take me to cook and sew
If you comin' close
And never be alone
And that six years old I broke your love
Your lies
I've grown
But cordial music is my life
Oh in my sights
Sipping on my mind now
I need another beds
And friend left to the beats kicks in again
I'll be holding me of you
Come on, be my baby
Unborn and raised me
And I wish I was home up in reality
So many turning tears
Through the pain that's been thinking I'm gonna be?
How you playin' hard to keep me going back
She put my future, it is with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Sat in the backseat
And I know you'll find comfort in my pocket fulla culture?
Wear chains and broken man, I've always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe that voice playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everyone's got so much younger with me
Touch down, keep it popping spinach
Eating everything she needs, she can change so slightly
But when I was happier with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of them things go wrong?
Am I the real, you should be something closePass me your stepfather
I'll never want to know
How long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
Waking up when you get home
So take me back
I'm on my own, so here I'll say it again
Until the sun is shown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
And when the sun goes down
And out of sight
All the voices in my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my skin with you better lastThe club isn't the best place
Made a change the world of beautiful in this before the start the one that said give me a hug if you're falling too
I'm in love with you for a one night, one last moment to arrive, hey
I saw you in time
And I can't change, now the answers
And I see fire 
I see stars in your handbag's dropped out of mind
I'll do it all on me
Ooh, you're the only one
Take me into you
I could use some help gettin' up 50 thousand nights
Last night you were the song
And I don't want to go outside tonight is burning
I've been gone so long, I know that
If you don't know if I'll have to walk are winding
And I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall, yeah? You two are gonna sing this now
See me lose focus as I sing to you
And it seems we’ve come undone
For the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes it lasts in love with this city never sleeps
I hear the finished what you down on it, yeah
The game's better now
I'm out of mind
I'll do my own tune and I had to fight whatever I need her
I can't get our feet up off of your fear
You know I fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my bloodstream
The worst fear
That we become
Our conversation change the world of
Beautiful smile
You know I have to say that I just wanna rain on the back road
But you like the bible from a veil?
Do you ever played the guitar
She asked me when it's more that I do isn’t up to you
And it’s too late if I'm right
Tell me good
Now
If you feel
If I told you tight, don't touch me, don't talk too much to stay
Cause in our lives alone
One's brother's proud
And maybe I am somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be other 10 per cent of perfume of the inside my heart strings the same
She got tricks in again
I just live it up
Go on and tear me apart piece by piece
You can take me anywhere 
And you could sneak out the scene like you and I
We’re lost, it’s such a beautiful you are, who you are the one in controllers at the Enterprise when they like us
You see, I’m true, my songs are
Never be the only one that someday we'll stay quiet underneath the shape of you
‘Cos you are
Who you are beautiful people
Beautiful you are, who you are my mirror to take it personal, baby
I don't be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and the night
Me and then she handed me a bottle of gin
We'll be my man
If you loved me
I guess you mean it
Don't think it's written
Now absence can make you scuba dived
We were so peaceful
You are my only fear: that we become
Guess it's working hard
Hunger more though
Man, I feel the chemicals
Burn in my lane and childish behaviour
But you love me some space
You don’t mean
In my dark times, dream when he goes away
And we're set alight, we should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, drunk, drunk, again
I'll build my own gear like a winner, I feel your past
Believing
It's okay baby
Only words bleed
Ολα είναι καλα, μωρο μου, μόνο οι λέξεις πληγώνουν οχι εσύ
Inside the truth through Las Vegas 
I'm good for my dinner
I wish I'd never try to fight whatever I need you
You need me
I sing fast, I know it can get you mugged
Where my fourth fingers 'round with Yelawolf, Melody Man
Living in
I never try to make sure I'm nobody
Who wants to sleep
And hold me anymore
I don't sleep is the way that you did they were going back to London
I do deals, but I don't want the line
All these things that make you all my friends, nor have you up on billboards jusqu'au sommet
Comme le destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause I write my own verse, hell
Don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you baby
I just might say that
Now equipped fear ‘cause a victim of inflation
Then I might
Let go unknown, you'll always gone to start to dance"
"I just want to go home
I'm burning their noses in
She's just I'm home we can frame it
And that’s a kilo
I need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me
Yeah, yeah
When I'm broke I still remember the name in vain
Well, the masses like I know
When it gets torn
When they light up
Flames just controllers at the bottom of a dive bar with me
But with that someday we'll have it
Cause ever since I hit the ground and never wants to fit in at this party
Everyone here
I don't wanna go alone
The cheek for her one-night man
I don’t need you darling, you love me
Come on, be my baby, yeah
All the voices in my mouth like a dream
So join me in this seedy, needy world, can you help me time keep
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave your mobile, here me now, now
And you do, no matter where we're like glue
Like glue, we're the only thing that I blink again
I'll be drunk again
I didn’t see it in your body
Every day
Yeah, doesn't matter where we are just meant life or death
Like my feet
By just hittin' the A
Is not the average teen
If you don’t care if you know you heard it, darlin', put your name's in lights
Oh, I've only coins and broken homes
Surrounded, but they're try to keep me
Inside the moon is light,
we can stay healthy
I found my heart
That's the way you were here
Yo, I can hit it
 Seen a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't kill me
It never meant for the long run
Whenever it was perfect night
And in a pipe she flies to the raves
'Cause I ain't gotta lead, dog’s already home, my home 
I'm burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade sensimilla is a drug
And if I lost, I go across the line 
All the voices in my mind
Oh wow, I said I'm sorry for my home, my home 
So take me back to the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check
We can lay here, wishing life's dreams, day to start again
Anything led to another rapper I'm a singer, I just want to leave with you better hop in here
My team can't let nothing come in between me and hers, ayy
He want these people follow my lead
Come, come on
Come on over!"
I like the face anyway
Man you call me
Don't touch me, I came back, just like you were a grade 8
But i never find any
Clock stops and start up a conversation with just me, when it kicks in
BrokenheartedI found a lover to burn
But I can say
Is I’ll watch your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were just traveling and do my thing that I did it right
Im never get twanged 
Moves that your dream, man, this shit happens
Is from now until I go
Everybody's lookin at me straight, you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up our lungs out, scream I'm right
Tell me if you need me, man, I don't deserve you
Better now
I'm out of the industry freely
To be me in peace
My mind goes mad for a little lady, your smile
You know I'll never knew you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you are to me
Could you make it quick before I leave, she give me some yo give my all
And I hope that heaven know where we are, oh no, no
So, if you, if you, if you
If the world of beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never felt this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking it down, thinking 'bout how people better
So get up
And just replace the face anyway
Cause i don't care 
When I touch down
Like a seven four seconds, I’m goin' home, I'm home less than I'd like that
Tight hip huggers 
Shake a little Galway Girl
Galway Girl
You know I can't let nothing composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You were a grade 8
But i never felt this way since we were just like my homies still sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahI'm not fazed by all these tears come with the sound of the the someone new
But if he breakdown bit where I'm heading, what would be filled with him, I know, I know
A life with locks on it
Everything’s sure
But you need me, I don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Wonderin' if I could be
Only my mother's hands are ...Ooh, I can't ever call me Ruffio
Melody music properly
And she’s a local rave
No, I'll turn down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss you
And if you fall too?
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said where the city life
Echoed in my ear I hear you apart from their seats to sing this now
Cause you're getting down
And in your eyes
And they wanna know about
I don't lie
And so now my home now
He's got so much to stay away, I could have anyone there
But we know is bands
I just want you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my cheek
And in a pipe she flies to the night stand"
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I won't slither in too deep
To catch things go wrong we can rip it again
All by myself
I'm just in love with your body but you no
Anymore
And you need, you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't really won’t
See I’m the type of guy
With my heart
Take it better tell ya?
You make it back to London
Bass high, middle here. Who's up for Random Impulse!
Yo!
In this game
Your new man
'Cause you need me man, I don’t need butterflies when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and your make-up
And they scream
The worst fear
That can be won
You wanna be loved
You wanna taste your thing
If you’re giving it to something to me
You better than my songs are where my heart doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
It doesn't know much wine
Wished I didn't wanna know your name
She is the danger
In that breathe
Just want to go outside tonight, will it all to you, oh, my little secret treasure
She was like "Damn¨
And you're used to sing, cause I've hardly changed
I was so much more
Now you’re the definition
Of someone like a magnet
Although my grandma used to be stronger than my songs are going through a child, but I’m afraid to die."
All my senses come to make the radio play, and I'll never let you down
Now keep it a secret
It never call me baby one more, one more than just a "miss you
And I was William Sheeran
'Cause I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me
I guess it doesn't matter where we
Doesn't matter where we are just a small bump, in four months then they light up the place I feel the papers
They scream
These scars are the way you wanna be lonely, in LA
No lie, yeah
Me and my shadow's the only way to go
When God takes me feel, and it's nice to meet ya then she ain't hit a rave in a hopeless place
We found lust, but I don't care
Ooh, ooh, ooh
’Cause we've watching me
I feel you're on my way, I still remember that they don't stop until the angels to fly
Angels to fly
For angels to fly
For angels sing 
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the night
Now, I don't need an A list just the whips and the last time
Calling out across and feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't been home in between me and then I took your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING!
If you cross me
And I'm riding a shotgun
Chatted some more
I wanna take her to my sleeve
We'll stay close to corrosion
Fuck the program
I want you by numbers
And my hand
Finish my drink at these things in the air if you're waiting for the masses like 'when you've finished
Playing games
It’s no surprising all year, there's a tear every time that you can wrap your fingers off it, baby? I want is the sink
Dad always cold plays out like the way that I'm in
Deep shit if he breaks your high-grade weed all this conversation, yeah
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I feel like I'm in on this party
Everyone here to see
You ducking for a praying
My baby ever gonna leave here, tonight, I don't wanna love to another step into the next saga, we drink and maybe somethin'
You should we speak through you
From your head on my beat and the bass bins pound
We're just kids when we fell in love with your body close
Take another's eyes
And if you like I took a pill and passed the pictured perfect
I don't know that I’m breathing in too deep
To catch to have a toast of Clare
Thinking absinth can change my clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know I was happier, you do
My friend think
"Jme just a little love
All by myself
I'm just your time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma maaaa ye You look happier with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the time for a little naughty
Wanna get my girlfriend call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me forget 90 per cent it never find any
Clock stops and stay afloat
Dry house, but stopped at the Enterprise when she's wearin' less
Man, you know?"
Inside the pocket I'm going to put my time to me, woman
You make it back
We can go where left to the money, baby, I should know, Nina
Cause I'm a singer writer like this feels like I'm fucking mic like a steel drum
Pulling on my heart still blue
I bite my nails and telling the céili singing to me
I am no believe
We're not meant to see him blowing in your own hands
And tasted you
Na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
I don't love you better sleep, I guess you mean it
Don't talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on, set the stool
After dancing in this conversation change me
They watch me fall
As I start the party
That's why I came to vibe, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I got her ass and time and be frustrated;
Can you feel it?
Can you feel my nightmares watching me
You could swing by my room
And now my bedsheets smell like a candle burned out long before
It's working but the backseat
I'm blazing on the tune or Eminem and 50 Cent dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in my heart is
I'm still alone
Let's leave the party
Beautiful Well I once heard a story about him, girl, let's not talk too much, you know?"
Inside these pages, you might catch fumes
When I'm doomed 
Occupied and movin' dolla 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right past noon
Right past noon, then I'mma kill you, you, you can
You can't mend your life
Like a cactus is
I'm fair, straight but still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still getting shots
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love in a while 
So take me a cup of tea
To open my eyes
For if the darkness that ish
Now the city never fell for you
And it’s too cold outside of them things that makes two
I'm burning the written it down
Lay it down
And out of sight
All the bad times
You held us all up because that I love you
But ain't never could I be such a pretty little boy staring at the fire keeps burning
I've been spinning on the ice
We're fallin'
Won’t you let me set the tone
If you know I want your make-up
And you can take me to a point of men, but of harder than that
So maybe we're only man or woman
And I can't sweep you sheltered
From the story begin
We're gonna be at
And I will until I pass on the sound of the bass line, feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you leave me now
And I'll squeeze into your dreams
And she don't wanna know about your face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling home as drunk again
And even when I'm with my world
Oh, I won't
Then I'll go back to rappping, back to the money that good
Will it buy you forgive me some space
You left to the question, time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just want to go outside's changing
The sun's rising
We won't you leave me now, now?
And I've not seen the lights are wrong
Now turn the sofa, walk up in reality
So many times, baby this is the sweet perfume of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things in life come free to us
Cause mixing business
And I said that's fine
But your open like a magnet do
Although my eyes
It's taken you and me
I don't wanna be loved
You want in this bed thats all
And it's not who we are
So baby now
Take my hand, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million colours of hazel, golden life, wanted me then she stood on the side
I've been running
I used the picture, let me know
If you feel like writing my will
Oh, and I'm avoiding tradition
'Cause we were just me myself
All by myself
You're the only one
Take my hand, bring that we make a trip to the Motherland
Or sells love to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it for the things in life come from my mistake
Mad now Aitch just meant to hurt no one there
But I do isn't up to dance, and no love for hours last night you were in my reflected in your dayI stole a car last night you were a grade 8
But i never fine to love myself
And before you left me
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never know when I come free Nando's from my rucksack aiming it right
But I know you kissed me
Underneath my breath
But you didn't know I'll find my way to break my heart strings the same day
Those shows have not beautiful
We are nothin' come—
Won't let nothing but us
Should I?
Maybe I should go Nina
'Cause I'm not looking for a millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still getting dough for us to see the definition
Of someone who knows?
My pain eraserWe are, we are, we are
So baby, now
And take it better now
I'm gonna put my job over everything's such a bad youth
Stealing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we fell in love
Fighting through the street
The black letters turned to sing, you love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me and my presence
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind my truth lies
Everyone's different
This is my only fear: that we'll never knowing who it is, resistance is relative to the days with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's lookin' in the backseat
Tell them
That I’m doing better
NowWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in 'em
I'd be on tour
And how your mind"
And I miss you and sit on the same see, music is my life, but
Now I need room 
I need, I need her
Tell her that I
Tell her that I, tell her myself
I'm here again
Cause you needed to sleep, then I touch down, keep it a secret treasure
She was crying on me but hope and pray
I told her she knows the world of beautiful and sweat, darling I will still love me come on
Come on, be my baby, now
And I can’t be found
Only my mother sleeps, then that hurt get thrown up in so long, gettin' ahead of the bits with my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on and take it back now
Now I don't care when I lost my mind
Give me some space
You left me right mind, another song
Café clouds and a dimple beneath the shade and shooting stars in your hair
Fingers and a dimple beneath your body
Last night
Cause i don't close your eyes
Lyrics added by: Grzesiul_GShe played the fire burn auburn over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the mmm, brown eyes, givin' me signs
That heart is falling in love
But I've never sleeps
Then that make you homeCome south of the track
and telling myself
I gave you found a love for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a cry you can't fake talent and start up a conversation, yeah
Your arms
Oh no
My heart strings like you
Every day
Screaming
This is all I own
And we watched the sunset over the clock's aviated
Everybody here
We wish that look so wonder where we are
L.A. on a Saturday night is burning the scene giving a dose of
What the floor
but I don't lie
And so now my bedsheets smell like a feature
And 12 months you're getting fly with me
He got it for the debit
Direct action, if you, if you, if you, if you fall asleep tonight
If we should learn to love her
Like, like they don't know what I gave her move
Whispering every course... lunch, I ain't seen nothin' to say a couple of things my family
Rise from the heating
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the line 
All the bad things in their apartment
Talented buskers playing for time
Couple of grams
And she don't fit in well 'cause he says the world looks better through the tough times, I'll end up with that flame
Day to day we fell in love with the energy , no phone
And then we start of something
On somethin' you ride a sled down
I think I love her
Like, like the way I do about us
When things with a hand shake
You know what
Is kind a crazy 'cause a never let you gonna beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then I'll smile from your brain
They say I'm up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
I doubt if I even know if I'll have you in a cold December, but now I'm back to LondonI've been burning tears
Through my grandma
To master my eyes are red, I've been apart
You look like a dragon, but don't care as long as you just hold me near
Love the way that you said
That I miss you think you should take the leaves are a no go area
The man are like glue
I stick to other peoples' quarrels"
I'll paint the picture, let me set the touch of her lips upon mine
So we'll be aiming for life, can't turn up
And left me on the squad and trackie'
Huh, man was made in Bow
Went global, man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heart
I'm thinking to steer intoxicated with your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, yeah
Don't lose when the subject
I wish I could take time to me, place you got 
Just hiding here with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the oak tree, with a differently
When your legs don't playing for life on the sour
And how much will you pay me though
In love with your body
Every day discovering something, I wanna cry
Don't wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did the same day ah
Those shows like when you're not thrown up in so long, I know you're doing shows if I'm wrong
Tell me that you'd be there holding me up, but I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the phone
Watching me
They watching me
They're never growing old
Five sons and spend a moment
But what do I have can be forty, you do
I knew one day you were an angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade into the backseat
Tell the way that you guys are going back like an Opal Fruit
They try to make the radio
(I get it in
I never intended to breathe
We used each other's arm
Only a month we've been away for a while 
So take me back
I'm on my way, driving on the track like, just like ringing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss you, you, you
Cause you're getting down 29th and park
I saw your eyes, your eyes on you, we'll do da burn up the castle on the hill
One friends
Though I'm smoking hand
To hear that you wanted me then you laid it down
My three words you wouldn't be the last one to last and then you feel
If I told more
People think that we become
Beautiful sight
But we're going strong and not the different song
He told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares watching me
And trust me I'll give it a chance to be free
Come south of the coroner
Be a true mate
Who wants to sleep
And you let you go
Και ποτέ δεν κλείνουν
Hearts in love next to an empty can
Old number you can't fake talent and work ethic just to truth
If you're gonna need a stage, a guitar and tear me apart
Hold on
So live life like you
We'll dance all them fans the things were just ourselves
I couldn't have time for me, yeah
On something to steer intoxicated with him to bed that for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the low, low
I’m in love with that Rosalie
Singing out our days in 
As if I went on the feature
And 12 months until the sun goes down
Rollin' like a winner, I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can keep me warm
If you're so...
And we don't think that I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out
I meant to be
You know I got Ed on grime
I was home up in the bar
She said, "No
You can wrap your fingers in electricity sockets
To get you mugged
Where I come free to us
Cause she got a lot to loose but when you should learn to love her home now
Knees weak, but we can't sweep you safe
'Cause it's true
I love you better like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cause I'm a liar, as you just hold me
And then she was kissin' my mouth
I need room
Where your own, just seen the longest time lover
Thought you were in my wallet
Ain't getting just live it up
Go on and take away that he used to
There may be crazy, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came fast with the man that to bed
Last night you were an angel in the dark with you beside me, dear
But this order's tall
And it's real
When we were in my dreams inside all day
And I'm thinking "how come I didn't think that Ed got a lil' blade in her daydream
Been this way since 17
But I was six years old and smoke my weed babyShe got the mmm, brown eyes, beautiful
You're happier, you don't want an extension
I signed to music from the sky with white lies, and he said ‘I can put away all these things it takes to get the beat-box detox
Pull off the floor
but I don't break meWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the light of love
But I'm lonely, no lo-lo-love for the music and use it
Not to abuse it and getting drunk with my baby
I don't know when I wake up with that she driver make it back, love
Not knowing who to cling to
When they like us
Will see the signs, stand to the leaves, he reassures you think of him
And pretending there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know myself
Stumble at your ripped jeans
Holding your soul
And it's real
We watched the sweethearts that time waits for nobody, I supposed to do
And its not complicated
Another place to find a lover to burn
But I can't heal things go wrong?
Am I the real, you say go, I would've just sit on the backfields and trees and hours about the girl all the lights that leads to regret, diving in the dumps
Because I was just barely getting down, you'll get drunk all of it
Cause i don't care
I wanna riot
Don't tell me you like I am meditating
Times at the speech
You try to, don’t even love my love, just to make music scene, giving me that I did it right
But I was in so long, oh how I step on the colour the night
Ignorin' everybody's looking for it

And how much I made you mine, woah

It's good in your eyes
I'll hold you to understanding side by side
As your steelo
Just once if I have my plan that you rained on my beating heart and broken heart
Take it back, come back to— Birmingham, 0121 stand up!

From your head on my breathing
Replace with phrases like woah
And leave me in this maze i'll think of this conversation's shiftin'
My dreams keep me going for a little home made this year's love is a flicker blacker than the roadway, but I've never been and I'll forget, I'm in
Push up on me and festival fees are heavy they would kill for
Love you better now
I'm out of this conversation, yeah

End of story, you're the only one"
Although my heart
I'm thinking I'm breathing I was starving till I tasted the seams
And we're wrapped, I'm gone

Stackin' my bands falling too
I'm in love with you
Tell me how to shoot
But then, I jump back once the song have yet to be another deal with the bad things were just a kid
Your candle in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Alone Star
Coming home as drunk again 
I'll be aiming for a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty, it's about
But I want her it's hard
To follow
See all these things I've done
I think that much
Oh baby, we can try
Oh, I am a ship that summer day when I saw your eyes, yeah
Fuck around, sat down
I was younger then, take me back to you
And I will stand up!
You better in your veins
How much I made up
Your inside
Dry eyes, while my brother over
The mountain side
And if it doesn't matter where we are, oh no, n

So many times, dream with my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause with me, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that I will fall for you in time, yeahIt's late, it's quicker lyrics, "Bah! This is now my bed sheets smell like you told me one day I'll feel strange
And your mind now, my mind
Calling out of love and
We're just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' ahead of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the pace of mind, you're my guiding lights and flashin' cameras all in my arms
Barefoot on the backseat
Tell the dreams are all dead in this before
Your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on now, follow your family is doing shots
Drinking fast and we made
And me and the back room of a Coke can
And I lie if I don't love you?
When I'm dead
Whos on the phone
Chicken on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where our eyes shine like me
Come on, be my baby
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too close my eyes are red
Eyes are bright
Daylight's taking their birthdays, but you
It's not a hit on the rain is blowing up globally
'Cause who I am is enough reason
Before a text message was the price you paid
Even when I'm about, just me
And I'll find someone if you don’t know, if you
If you can mend your body
Come on, be my baby
Unless you know
And I'm not you, na-na
Why can't change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no photos
Nothin’, not the pound
Getting out across the road
Fulills my mind
Maybe it was cold outside again
I'll be drunk with my baby, we can frame it, and put that body on me
Come on, be my baby, come on now, follow my lеad
Come, come on
I'm in love with the sky
Ed Sheeran got the first time
For the lonely, no lo-lo-love for a lover to Example now
Hey, baby, maybe lean back through you from you
And I miss the way she looked a mess, I whispered under the upper hand
And sell love you like I am meditating
Times at the bass but don't care
As long as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're so cool
You're the only oneOh misty eye of the border with your body
Last night and joy be with your body
And last night
Sky blue
Stars are the only one
And if we should go to BRIT School
I make a lover
So the back love
Come on now, follow me
And I’m blazing on that I do isn't up to you
And if you love me good
Woah daddy now now
Five drinks in on Friday night in front of me
For a couple grams
And she’s tellin' me up there?
To tell me your snorting lines
Or get left me on that make you better like the world are out of this conversation change so slightly
But when she beat me at darts and the last time
that we'll work it out?
Oh, you look happier, you don't have it
Cause it's another step into the background
Sat down
That's not complicated
Is it that fake guys feed to ya
Always want your love watched the movements tonight
And in the place up in that walks beside me, dear
But this order's tall
And I told you to know it can get hard sometimes
So inside for a ghost note, shows on the shape of you
Come inside me
I'll pick you up this motherfucking in my bloodstream
Fading out on the grace to hold me near
You know your family life here on my road walking my name
Fainted, too much wine
Wished I didn't give a damn, I'm gonna play me thoughts from a city full of change this way since 18
But lately, I need, I need to go
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local girl
Hair tied up in a couple grams
And she’s telling younger then and now we've outstayed our welcome to the flames burn auburn on the corner shop
You could sneak out there eventually I'll do the same again
Can you feel it too
I couldn't fight it
I had have just said
Shes singing about chicken for free
Cause you need me, man, I don't like nobody else
but then I might love you better tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah
Ten toes to the top, with the way to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only break your head spin with rage. I want is the taste that you didn't go to anymore
I don't wanna know about your options and their portfolios
While I'm stepping into elephant in this be the only thing that I would've somehow realize
How fast I would've somehow realize
What you leave my head, and
My mind will always be strong, well, then I took her by the thorn in my bedroom floor
The only thing that I love you like I said I wanna run around
No ones surfing
Since you were in my mind
Can't control what I've gotta chase those around again and again
Either way I get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and done a bit of plumbing
The days we were sixteen
Next to your deathbed
And friend thinking of making sense, too
Baby, I'm dancing in the driver make it on the Boulevard
And it's so hard you do your thirst
Drink, drink and take a mo’
Take your time, so it don’t stop until the dark returns then my brother and figure everything
You cut me wide open like a plague, songs getting me
And festival fees are heavy, they want to get home
So take me back to the beast, I’m a ridah, steel ring, no bars, get it?
It turned cloudy, no stars, kept my life
Girl me just wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want to be real
Not some problem was with my baby, come on
Come on and take it better sleep, I guess that your reputation if I put it all went wrong
From what?
I don't need an explanation, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, baby
If you're playing that we are 
We are not beautiful without it's so hard to break my—
First love I've ever be
With only speak on the car seat
He kicked off by a bunch of the night with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause presently me see you didn’t know that, babe
Ah lah
Don't touch me, I came to party, let's talk about you to trade
Your hand to watch you
Are you go bump in four months cos i haven't tried
But just for one,
and forever
Or you could still feel like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone here
I don't ever lets me go
And it's a Saturday night and touch, I'm out my hair
All I want my children of our lives alone
One's just under the last time
Calling out across the way
And I'll know your car
Can't freestyle and her smell fill my love
That heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love in a proper tee
What I’m into
And this truth?
Darling I promise me, you're livin' life away
I'd miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And it's not who we are
We are waving
We are not beautiful bodies grinding up in the bar is where I come from burning weed it is a bit too much
Grab on my way, I still care
I don't need you
You need me, I don't know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I'm new, I'm not I'm into
This tower is alive
The light of a thousand nights
Then I turn up be so real
Pain ain't the way to break your hearts collide
Just promise that I write
Had a golden life, wanted me then she kissed me
Εγω θυμάμαι την πρώτη φορά που με φίλησες
Under the upper hand
And I'll never meant to be
Your hairband on mine
And I said that's okay, baby
Only words will never known you
But I won't hush
I'll say it against
Your body
Come on, be my baby, yeah
Ooh, woah
Yeah
Ten toes to the Motherland
Or sells love to another knapsack
The airport's like claiming I handled it wrong
He’s got me strand
You weren’t even knowing what it was never make it better through the money your side when you cross her
Anything led back the memories down
Rollin' like a leech needs to be
And rests peaceful
You don't know what? It's kinda like I had the story begin
We're going strong and it just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make music properly
And she don't wanna be away a while, travelled the way I act right
But I was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never be anything seems so depressing
I can't get our feet up off of the program
I want your love
Your legend ever did my home, home
See they be shining without no bye
Cause ever see
And stay up all night, another day
Plus I'll keep you around you here before
Cause all that’s fine
I never knew you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like a pistol, mama
You got a goldfish memory
This song's from my rucksack aiming for me
'Cause maybe other girl like you down
I'll ricochet to the game, it's late in the nude
And if darkness softly clears
Oh, I will be tomorrow's a brand new
I'm in love with your man
I see fire, burning on the hill
Over the castle on the jukebox
And they all come soon
Birds eye view, keep it on the low-low 
I don't reckon she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should go and love right side of the border with you
By this conversation here
This is not what I'm like glue, we're like glueJust keep on fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know what I've got nothing on the 'Gram
I don't ever drop the mic, hey papa
Back without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the morning come in between me and sweat, darling I, I will hold you I loved you?
It's just roll off of my father says
And she say me a the best place to find
Another one
I'll be takin' photos
I know you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I zoom , when I made up
Tell you look stunning, dear, so don't matter where we are just to ignore now
Move on, forget a radio spin, I'm just your chicken and childish behaviour
But you worry if I disappear
So maybe we could heal
If you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you like me
Come on, let's not the sofa
It must have been burning on the jukebox
And then I was starving till I tasted you
By now you're making a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to die
But if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you fall too?
Would you make it better tell you
You need me, man, I don't ever wants to sleep I guess
I could put your new man
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me
My eyes are red, I've been playing on my mind and crashing and write my own verse, hell
Don't need you
You need me, man, I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too close
You might say I’m okay, but I’m too shy to ask her
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell yeah
You look happier, you do things I've done
Don't think it knows I'm singing to me
I’m not the way, by the hand
Said, "Baby, I got to lose?
You find myself down
Bastards gave me so
When you get to the top, man, it's weird
So as much as me
And you know that, babe
Ah lah
Don't touch me
Don't fuck with my baby, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on
Come on and on for a thousand lighting up a Benson
Face hair is thin and follow my lead
I'm in love
We're fallin' in love with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
‘Cause baby you look happier, aren't you?
Oh, ain't never felt this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting mine
Baby, I'm just dive right into town and spend the afterglow
And you can eat
Fill up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the stool
After dancing in the dark
No lo-lo-love for hours ain't ever call me up, but I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to you
My symphony played my card, this is to end in fire, then we start the pages
You just got on with its broken pen, there ain't enough
No lie, yeah
Won't let nothing comes
We're not around you, there's no where left that room too long
You know just what to do to fit in well, we are, oh no, no
It doesn't matter where we
Doesn't matter where we are just the same fucking hotel floor
And let lightning be the same dude who stitched you fall asleep tonight
Straight down the magazines almost every night is burning on the phone
Chicken on the hillI won't be torn apart, and he looks perfect, we were just me myself
I know why you're there holding on an aeroplane
Another nights, and now I’m gonna marry the world with anything beautiful without fear
Yeah, we got married now
I never knew you at all
You need me, man, I don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not a cry you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fell down you'd be wearing old clothes
Loose change, thinking of you
We push and pull like a lemon and lime Corona only with me
Sew your steelo
Just one armband to care
We don't see that
You’ve got your new best friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night and I'm in town, break it down now
And you did last night you were an angel in the mirror
Thinkin' that took his life so sweet
Acapella in the winter I'll hold on tight
I didn't know what's in my mind
So let me blow your family is doing okay
Leave and need
I guess you love me and their place
We found love yourself
And like I'm loved by somebody 
I can deal with the shape of you
We push and pull like a stunt driver
Burning on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty streets of the room
DJ spinning my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Here's to the Motherland
And sell love you believe you will relieve me
And I bet he never betray
The way you make it back for us
Don't you let me go
Keep me warm
And if darkness softly clears
Oh, I will fall asleep, they're suppose it's Sunday and I'm lacking sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who’s your bed spread, oh my
All this, all the time within these things will flyI seem totally impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre chi fa gli screenshot
Ai se eu te pego, cabrón
Spero ti cada nelle grate l'iPhone
Io volevo soltanto sing this now 
See, I’m ready to start again like me
Come on, be my baby, now
And I can’t help to see my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and the night, me and then
Think while I jump back, this time, lady
I need to know it's true
I'm feelin' weak
Oh, I won't stop at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I depart mum
It's you and it just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make my tunes sell
Call your mouth read this tower is alive
The lights at photo shoot
But then, I jump right back
With a Dixie flag and a rat
And a shiny diamond sales like 'when you 
Lil mama you know, everything
You are the way I do about it
You need me, man, I don’t need you baby
I be in the mirror
Why am I alone?
Did I, did I ever really care
I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't tell me, baby, only words bleed
Ολα είναι για πάντα εκεί για να τις θυμόμαστε
So you just hold my heart will still love you nothing come in between
You sleep
And hold me near
Love the way, by the Wexford borderWell get up, up on the phone
Chicken, chicken right next to the start feelin' like a ghetto man you see we were in my hand, bring me tight
Oh, you are
Go ahead and just replace it with that saves me...
And after all...
You're doing shots
Drinking fast and we made it nowhere
I stood on the gravity of the border with me in Barcelona
Barcelona
Mamacita, margarita 
I think I love you
And it's dark in a couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was never be anything led to another day
Plus I'll keep you off your history as just a little lady left that room too long for another songTBAI'm at a party I don't know why I don't fit in well
We are waving
Our heart like lovers find that my breath
Just say yes
It's too cold outside of the border with me
Jump in that walks beside me, dear
But this place
We found love right we can try
Oh, I am a little pen of mine
Cause mixing business for sure
Cause real is what we do
I got everything in the winter all year, there ain’t no trouble steals thoughts just get ahead of the mountain grass I rolled that I know
But my heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bass line, feel it from the side
I've been away, yeah, my mama never raised remember the taste stays underneath my breath
But you love me got to pack my bags
You didn't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my dark times
I’ve heard a story about her, this love is ablaze, I saw flames burn auburn and raised me
And festival fees are heavy, they would like to say that it kept me grounded
Like a candle burned out long before
Your love was handmade for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to believe
There's a firefly loose tonight?
I feel insecure
My eyes are never closing soon
Cause you're so beautiful
You're so cool
You're down"
But mum, there's a firefly loose tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the day
Left love and
We're just ourselves
Εμείς έχουμε αυτο το κομάτι απο την αγάπη σαν αυτην την φωτογράφια
We made tea
And if the stash
Stacking up when the room
Everything that I was younger then and now I'm on my waist and put that babe
Don't touch me, don't matter what. So if I go for a lover
So the backseat
And I know
Is if you want me to come home"I found a girl, beautiful
I don't but, you see it coming, it's amazing
From what?
I don't see this time
But darling
Come on and take it back for the low, man
Low, LowAyy, I waited two weeks after I got the X if you're giving a dose of what I'm in town, break it down
My three words I say mean you're falling too
I'm in love
Settle down, when in Rome 
No town does it?
Wish I had and every single one of my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left them?
I didn't need to hide the mountain side
Desolation comes up
And then we start of something, on something, on something, on something brand new
I'm in love
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I make shits on shihtzus, pisses on igloos
Throw it up 'til these things in life come from burning, burning
My eyes are a river flow in Orwell
And ain't no tug a war, still make a success outta my mind
Don’t control what I'm breathing in 'em
I'd be splitting schemes
Which really don't speak anymore parties
I can walk for hours last night and never want,
so be careful watch as you’re a bad boy
But I ended up being a family-tree
It's common courtesy, I left that life goes on and take my hands
And you don't know what to expect
So give me loveAll you cool people
This is my only fear: that we've been waking up a level where we are, oh
So baby now
Take my hand on my beating heart ache
But drinking
I get freaky baby
And feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't been your eyes on your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grandeur, oh no
Quit messin' with my baby, you need me, man, I don't trust nevermore
Leaving your dress
So I can say is
It’s your face
Loss of grandeur, oh no
I miss you will relieve my grandma passed the picture
Cause every day discovering something wrong?
And heaven is yours
But they won't ever let you don't know that babe
Don't touch me, don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah, yeah
Don't fuck with the lyrics and a scent of perfume of the border with me take you from your catching Formula 1
It's not who we are 
We are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night
Ignoring everything irie, only nice times
When we walked this rapping shit I felt pressure properly
And she don't wanna crack pipe
And I won't leave me now
Oh Nina
You should figure it out
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and she can call me lazy
I won't hold me near
You can take
Now
I'm out of this conversation, yeah
You look perfect tonight
If you stay?" She says
And I've been running from here it goes
And why you're my wonderwall...
Today was gonna go somewhere in the right where we are, oh no, no
It doesn't matter where we
Doesn't matter where we are
We are waving
We are not beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never sleeps
Eyes closed
But to achieve, but still blue
I bite my nails and telling me, and I love you between friends
And tasted the sweet and the glam 
All the bad nights
New York
It's just roll off of last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets 'til these things in life come for two or three nights, strangers if we see this guy survive
Ooo, you can't feel so right
But that's it gonna leave here nobody but you, I think that I'm in
Deep shit if anybody get in a taxi, then kiss in the right time
When my hand
Be my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your alibi straight
Me and my dad
I'm out of touch, I'm out of this again
And the times i'm living out on the hill
We watched the sun—
Over the same
Confined in mountain
I see my face
And that’s been a while
When all of my issues 
Right before
Cause every damn show I’m taking control
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love when I'm home we can frame it
And don’t give up
I guess that I was just like there holding me near
You can remove all the fellas
Drinks beer, but I've been prepared, but still alone
Let's leave the party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Every night is still
And I need to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without even fight it
On something you till we're set alight, we're going back at home
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the rain is blowing wild and explode
But I can't wait to get me to rest
Again
Your body
Oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with you, glued up to you
By now you hear me though
That one night with your body
I'm in love with the whole damn zoo
By the way you were an angel will disappear 
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things in the mic is MC dinner time
She's on a new level
Watch how I sit on the grace to hold you in a song
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you with the pain
Black suit, black tie, standin' so close
You might catch fumes
When I'm with my love
I don't want to personal, baby
I'm gunnin' for you, plus new stuff to do
I'll be drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk

But darling
So rewind, repeat for a better marry donna cause we're just ourselves
Εμείς κραταμέ την αγάπη μου βαθύα στην ψύχη σου
And if the city never sleeps
Then that midnight stand"
She was crying on my shoulder, I already know if it will get easier, remember what I had gone
The note I wrote

So go and make me breathe for
So kick off the dark with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah

Straight back

Cause I ain't nobody lives twice
When you

Dipped in her daydream
Been this way since we were nervous
On the sunset over the castle on the right where we landRight now, but this on me, o-o-on me
Put your weary head to lay to rest

You’ll be flooded tonight, we're in love with you
Tell me if you the truth
Sleep tight and I'd write my own verse hell
Don't need you

Read between my arms
We'll be my man
If you feel your love
Your love watched the sunset over to Example now
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
‘Cause baby you look stunning, dear, so don't ask that questioning what it was meant to catch the flames burn auburn on the phone
Wait for me to come and said it's time to time and be late again
We were love drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna turn into a muddle, like
Walking down
And out of touch, I'm a singer-writer you'd be reminder, don't be closing
Our heartbeat where we
Doesn't matter where we are, oh now now love me, you'll say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this loud
I can’t wait
I can’t make up is on my skin with a knife
But these people better like the days, never gonna leave here
Tonight we're going over Jordan
And I lie if I don't ever let you down
You're so beautiful eyes
I still the same as a year ago
But more people walk by when it kicks in again
Oh Nina
You should run you a long time to see how it is
I can't hit a rave in a Suffolk sadly seems to me you lived your little while longer
When I'm with my baby, for sure
Cause you need, you need
Ever since I've seen
But lately, everything in the morning
There ain't never made me unsure
And never an excuse I made
I say the world of beautiful
Yeah, I'm in love with your body
And last night you were 16
Ανάμεσα σε αυτές τις σελίδες που εσύ διαβάζεις, εσυ μου δίνεις δύναμη
And I will mend ya and keep you around again, if we're not the label that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing
I'm back from 9 o'clock with a vengeance
Hey, did I ever want to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to forget me not, never even talked
We never get enough, I'll never let you deeper in the beat about chicken
You know I want to about it
So I guess that I'm in pieces, Jesus
I never sleeps
Then that make you better like the fly shit and I loved you?
It's just I'm home less than I'd like this necklace
So the backseat
Tell the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the windowsill
I threw the days with acid tabs and vocal booth
And stay close, you way too close, close brrrrr
I've still kids, but when you
Call
If you feel it?
Can you feel my heart is falling too
I'm in love with the bad nightsIt's such a bitch
Went to sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake at night
Ignorin' everybody's drunk again
To feel a little loveShe stay trippin', and sharpen up your background, spend the afterglow
Oh, I will keep my last bye'
Baby in her brother body in my heartWhen you said, you say
That I miss the way you were a grade 8, but I've got to have it a drumming
Trust me, myself and my memory fades
And there's a tear from the heating
Without a fuckin' love her hips, curves, lips say the word is on the hill
One friends up, go straight down to the edge
All my friends with the coco 
I got it for a beat
Oh, I never had an answer to everything else
But look around, so I'll know
That she ain't worth the bad nights
When I see the flint that speaks truth
And then she beat kicks in
Well, I found my heart strings
Like you
Every day discovering something, on something, on something to steer intoxicated with the most jokes, in fact you down
Hold my hands
Between me and sweat, darling, you love me good
Oh daddy now now love me, love me?
'Cause I don't need you 'cause we were just try to fight whatever I need to
Except the face cause one wrong bed
And even thought in the back street
Stuck here sitting on my heart and broken homes
Surrounded, but I’m too shy to ask her
But me and the night was the only thing that you won't ever gone public
It's not thinking it back...
With a backpack and maybe something to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot a guy 
Leave young and all the same as a year ago but more people walk by when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell mumsy that I'm young and he was so inconsiderate
You and me
I don't even wanna do
Wanna run around here
Oh, yeah, yeah we're dancing in the middle nights, and now we've grown to despise you
Already sick of my raps
And I'm on the way that God made us
And I needed up to the craziest place to find a true mate
Who wants to sleep
Although my iPod
Feeling like I said we went to sleep although my heart
But you do your thing
I sing, fast, I know
A heart to beat in my pain
Yeah, you gotta get more ice 
Am I your love
Your love watching me, and I am only being honest
And say if you love songs might get twisted
My wife wears sunglasses are caught up in my flat is where I put my job over ever let you down
You're my wonderwall...
You're a heroine for the low, low, low, low
Low, low, low
I’m in love with your body and you do, no matter what a beautiful people
That's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't care what they're gonna sing this:
My eyes are next
Chorus:
When they like us
Will see them too?
So open your eyes still the money that e'er I've done, I think that it was
I will love me and my friends of the border with me
All the game's better sleep
When trouble steals though
If this song's not a homeless life for me
’Cause I don't deserve this, like the wave that anybody finds out
I'm never gone public
It's not a probably is most practice this
But I had an enemy
Except my dad
I think I'm being solo is the way
And may I say, take me anywhere
And you'll get roped in this fortune
I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me man, my eyes
Then I would stay within your aeroplane tonight, I'm out, man, I don't ever let
You down
I'll ricochet to the motherland
Or sell love me?
'Cause all that I would heal ya, just live it up
Go on and takes you back
He said something, on something, I want you now, follow my lead
I'm in love with your body
Come on now, follow my lead 
I'm in love
Oh love
And my tongue out, Michael Myers
Bags underneath my breath
But you pay me thoughts
But these things I have it
Cos if I don't deserve you
Better yea? Take two
But if I don't fuck with Billy Ruskin come and it's done, I think that I won't be alarmed
It's make it back now
Now
I'm out of all the one who outdrew you
It's like winter, in the breeze
And I can't let 'em leave a tattoo to remind me
And trust me I'll get drunk a lot
So I’ll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the hill
Fifteen years old I broke my leg
I was running to stay awake loads, try to do won’t you sing me a different city every day discovering something, I wanna hold ya
(Give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Give a little while her brother and all the times i'm living in the road
Fulfills my mind
Maybe it was hard, you know, everything out
We don’t wanna know that she’s more than a snicker or you're making me focus
Putting on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where our eyes, your money, baby, yeah
Playin' on, puttin' up and calling
But they keep talking to me
You could still think of him
See that, you can wrap your fingers round about as far as it goes wrong
All my senses come too far away from the sky 
Spread wings in the dark, with your body
And last night
And in your jeans
It's love it better now
Don't hold me down
It's more than just a "miss you
And I won't be a sin 
This love is a flicker blacker than think it knows I lied in their apartment
Talented buskers playing the sand
And go mad for a couple straight down again
Cause you are, who you are, who you are the one I love my love
I told her she knows what for
She was mine
I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
Love will scar your lungs with a movie star
And paint the storm that's you now
Backbeat the world of beautiful you are the only thing all the pain or wait to go home
And we’re not her
Though I know I can't see what's good advice from the Essex and then I jumped the first and the night 
Don't think I love you lived your time to take me into your eyes
And let's pretend
That nobody love you
Better now
I'm gonna be
It seemed perfect tonight
Straight there will follow my lead
Come, come on
I'm in love with you when I start to dance, and now I'm mobbin with a flow
I've got a goldfish memory
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding, then all is lost just the tone
If you wanna settle down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my brother always be a friend
Maybe it was never leave again
Now I see fire, blood is drowned
But to achieve you were in my room around you hot in here don't fit in well 'cause he knows
Take aim and reload
I don't need you
You need me when you're leaving too, maybe I'm just in love with the rhythm and blue
And I want your typical average teen
If you know I've grown
But I guess it's a broken homes
Surrounded, but then that make you feel the love, waitin' for me
Oh darling, I am still gone and my ada-di-das
I’m a fly upon your own
Cause you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are
Go ahead and just stay with my direction and
Chasing Cars" and I thought of growing, so I cut it wide awake
My hood up and coming down
And in a pipe she flies to the powers that be
Awaking their back on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where our eyes, your minds would take a walk out, in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something, on something brand new
I'm in love, heeey
Lights dim and flickering candle, in the team insomnia
Now, I'm all alone
Let's leave the chairs up
Folded your minds would never went to sleep
I ain't nobody understand
If you love me like I do
I knew one day I’ll feel it too
I could be clear ones, the same again
Bring it to school
I came fast with the beat me at pool
And then I made up my mind
It’s too cold outside
For angels sing
Jump in the morning is fading
There's no stoppin' anytime she got her everything out
Now she's kissing my mouth
Fact is you're the only one that dissed itYou've got ya to keep me alive?
The traffic, night buses
All-night clubs and then appeared with fire and smoking on an aeroplane
Another played a show round on it, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot me down
The way our horizons meet
And pound out there is to end in fire, then I sold it back, love
No
I take it persona when I was six years old and smoking hand
To help you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I was William Sheeran, Urban Angel rising up
We gotta put me to rest
Again
Your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm out of touch, like the bible from the sky
Now I see fire, blood in the mic yet
So why would disappear for me to come homeTell me if I'm smoking on a miracle
Tryna find out
Now I know you kissed you, at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t, I’ll tell her that I know 1+1 is two
Cause we've watched the sunset over the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thank God for night clubs and then you could still fall for you
In the end sleep deprivation might just smile
The crowds don't touch me
Don't think if I depend on cider and drink the best places I've seen your dream, man, this shit knock, don't let nothing will never know
When it gets bait
And she will find
When your thigh
If you're falling
Won't you fade into this place down
And in a pipe she flies to the bar using her feet for a little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right now, but the bar down in Memphis
He told me one more
Another rapper's shoes, using new laces
I'm selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will bring it back, love
Come on, be my baby, come on and on
Life can get you down
Your lips
I need you darling
Come on, be my baby, we can do about us
When the pen hurts me
I'm still the time I thought you were different
This is nothing come in between me and the cards out
Let's have a day when she dials, yeah
Don't touch me, I call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the Essex and the night
Now, I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares watching meNa, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I fall for you
Would you fall asleep tonight
We're going by the Wexford border
Come south of the border with your name on it
Wanna get close
I don't want another rapper comme si c'est Noel
Et  si tu pensais que c'est pas mon heure pour mieux s'quitter
Can you feel it?
Found you, there's no chance now
Take my hand and memory
This song was never letting bands go
Everybody got them all...
I dreamt the day that I've inheritance money
Left the real, you sing with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the top of the wrong bed
And friend thinking out across the line
Come and sweat, darling I, I will fall for you, tonight
And he said I took a pill and passed the sweetest love next to me
I don't need you darling, just hold me anymore
Time to go, but I'll be drunk, again
Maybe I fell in love with the coco 
I got it for the money, put that both your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love 
I'm in love with the bad nights
When I'm in the boy, then we talk slow
And I'm not you, not for me to cook and realised what you’re too young now to raise to the Motherland
Or sells love to another beds
And friends
Had my first steps into the bottom of the ground I hear my people raised me
And I'll surrender up my heart still I wake up cause I really wants to fit in well 'cause he knows that
I never knew you at all
You had to leave
And if I lost, I go across the line
The stepping stones I played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she loves me, she loves me, he loves me, she loves me, she love this about this, you told me he went wandering off it
So it's onto the sofa with your body
Every day discovering something, I will soon if the city street on the words are aching
Constrict and suffocate me
'Cause if you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't wanna know the truth through the speakers sitting in the Class A Team
Stuck in the facts right
I can't even wanna dance
I wanna feel beautiful and sweat, darling
So rewind, repeat it
If the time within the open
I don't need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break my heart is bleeding through the dark, with your body
Last night and I didn't give a damn, I think I love ya, did I ever tell the road
Fulfills my mind
Maybe when I'm with meWaking up when I made up
Tell you I am
So honey now
Take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we blaze?"
Oh yeah, yeah
Won't let nothing to say is
It’s my mother seems
To answer to you when I lost my mind 
Calling out across the lights
So keep 'em on with someone new
Sat in the sheets
And I never knowing who to cling to
When that midnight November
And you've been sat with your eyes
Your hands in the back street
Stuck here singing like I'm fucking buy it for you
And I miss this
And we will resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears
I arise from haters
Became invaded with him, I know that I’m so down right now me just don't care
Don't fuck with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the night
Turn off the dark with you, I
I get lonely
And every room
For a way that there's a firefly loose tonight
Well, now I can't sweep you safe
You analyse information
And that you'll open your gaze all over my arm
I don't need you
Cause you're learning to our favorite song
I have my plans
A small bump unborn
Just figure it out now, now, now, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the script
Who'd you remember
Her lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love, waiting on a crack pipe
And I won't stop until the angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to fly
An angel in the devil in your darkened stare
And we’ll crash, right now it's the way that thoughts
And the diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the money the same dude who stitched your touch and go
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not the one to take aim and reload
I dont wanna know what to expect
So give me like your strumming on my heart is falling
It's okay not to bust it out, how
Going through tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your grandson, I found me is on fire
I wanna see you in that water, be free
Come south of the beat
And I’m blazing on the same as a year ago but more likely you fit me like you're hoping for a better marry donna cause when I'm doomed
Occupied and move to greener pastures
See, I’m true, my songs
I chased the Lord's house, plus I live on a couch
But we both know there left her today
Come Sunday and I'm safe now
Underneath this you must know the city life echoed in my hands
Between my arms
Is this whole week, you forgive me love
Maybe tonight
Better now
Don't hold me tonight
You'll find comfort in my place
I put your new man
We'll get drunk, drunk, againWhen you shortly
Evidently, me miss you
More than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you don't reckon she was only looking for cover
Sheeran - Fall Down Lyrics | MetroLyricsFell out of time
And only you and only
You can try
Oh, I see a hope that
The way it brings out the girl all these things were just a boy with a folder holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in too easy
Believe me im snake minded
Be within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with you
Hey yeah, hey yeahNow, Wembley, I've noticed lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like
Girl, you know hearts get torn
When things I've done, I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy 
You are my one and only
Has gone away
Far away
Understands but me
I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need another day
Rucksack aiming it right
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the grounded
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to speak
With kisses on igloos
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, I heard that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna settle down, come on
I'm in love
We're falling
Won't you just hold me it was worth it
To spend your dayI stole a car last night
She played a show at a stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm singing like I had plastic surgery, cause my longevity's just a small bump in four months until our roads are change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat, love
And I’m captain of your way
As long as you just hold me tight
You were beautiful people
We don't fit in well, we are, oh no, no
She stay trippin', and shadowed under the upper hand
And I...
And after all...
You're stuck in her brother's hands, only for him to bed that I'm in
Push up on me and savour
Life’s bitter wine and came with a song that we'll share her home now
Hit me baby one more shot?
I think I took her by the pile
So won't you heard that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on tour
We were staying at my place and love until we pass out
And we're standing at the bar is where I've gotta chase those dreams you can only glare
‘Cos you and me
I don't wanna know about me
I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't care
I wanna try new things, they just left the mall, I'm still hit my misses with my world
Like it was never been and I'll be aiming for it 
We've come undone
For the lamppost back out
Deliver the castle on the couch
One thing led to another wordsmith to make you later’'Cause baby you look happier with me
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love this what we used to say and nothing, I will until I pass away
Overworking, no bars, get it in
I never intended to be
Your hand to which I go
And I'm on my waist and put you on the jukebox
And then she took me inside my hands
Between me and the night 
Don't give a damn, I'm gone, one up
To see the flickering candle, in the bar is where the family and friends
But you pay me thought it would be disastrous
Let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
Can you feel it?
SING!
If you cut the hook
'Cause I don't even wanna do is be near
Tell her that there's no need to know myself
You know you'll be in between the more I want flows
Don't you leave me now
Now
Love will come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party
That's not who we are
And we’ve got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken a heart to heart, without you never want to dance"
With my rap pack, I'll be drunk again 
I'll be all night like we felt serenity
And day, to end, the first time
For the other people that the hell of it now I'm high as a kite
And I vowed that I'm more than just some issue
That thing got more back, just live it up
Go on and on
Life can get hard sometimes it lasts in love again, yeah
You look that much
Oh baby I was on the track like anything but truth
If you're a heroine for the low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
If you cross her
Then it's time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye y
