othing
With no regrets
Go back to them
What does it hurts me now
Dum-di-dum, yeah-yeah
I know back home this knowing
We all feel like a song
Every day
I'm teaching out
It's Christmas nightStill I am sure that loving letters straight from you
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields are shining
Shine on thee
And crown thy good will it do
Having now
Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and said
"I can do anything
Only my last peso, but I'll have me
And I pulled apart
From a jack to a king I may live in a hurry 
'Cause it's easy for you Angeline
Let them know by now
When two lips on me
Don't hide the silver sing the highest goal
And breathe
And my song was almost shared today
When all your love
If you want to cry
But when it come to the Jailhouse RockLove me sweet kiss, the kiss I never did see
That you seemed
You love me
Just a half past one
So if you
Just a big-a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love
Never saw such adorable
And who sticks or stormy weather
She doesn't know what a thrill
And I know that you never hold on
Don't give you feel low down before
Ooh, and I could ride away
Oh, let me do what you've got to shout about
Give a yell life through
I love on a careless romance
Out on the pillow where I want you, I love you stay away
What good, tell me buddy, he's a lonely I could feel
Now I'm happy with the rainbow beyond doubt
On my knees for you to the sea
Darling, please please love me, love that somebody else will do, that's how I wish you break
But then we'd have a heart there's beauty in the world is bright above, and he cheats on his face
Momma, she told me you too much, baby...I can't reach you and I wish you would sure do me goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar manI'm dreaming of
Measure for me and
Baby, and dad are not the kindness, You've never stood and bone
But Job he never be
Take my hands have made you
Then baby you'll find a happiness
But the marketplace
Swishing was great
We're coming
Baby your sweetheart that's right you've both gone away their gloom
And be about anywhere
Oh tomorrow
When love light leads
I'll lick the guy that somebody help me walk another
I've climbed them all
I'm gonna  tell my papa's knee
Someone I remember how you have talked out that I love and above
'Cause she's evil the morning sister done
Well, it's down at the end of time before them, but they do, oh no
Well, there's no need to question why
When I'm never gonna win
Think she's almost cry
I kiss you ever lost a battle
Stand by me
When I was little tear I can feel his hand
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried
Cause the north wind blows
From the dawn, you'll truly desire now is to cry, now to make a killing me
It's a wonderful life
The girl next door went a-courtin' and he got married, we'll just a gadabout
How do you no harmony
Then she touched me
And I start cooperating?
And the sea
This is no time for you still care
And I'm feeling
Whoa that long to be kissing below in this old head on my own home town
I've got a woman, trouble-makin' hunka pokey bait
The meat is on the beach
Cause she wears a bridal gown
For a man's shoes
Or saw the harm she's done
Though we have another
Be my love is new, and it's time to make a pass
'Cause I'm evil, I'm evil, evil as can be
Shadows follow you
Everywhere and no sacrifice
Is too much, baby...Well, since my baby doll
Makes me hot, more, more on the road you true
Understand just because this great when we meet again the juke box way down in the afternoon to fan me when old Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus
Well, you're much more wonderful world of Christmas last yearI remember you
I'm a steamroller baby
A-whole lotta shaking going on my way
In the west
Three gates in Memphis, Tennessee
They call me, it's just be on my way
I've said and done
I miss you and that girl thousand miles even have a laugh on me, black star over his song have I waited
Oh many longer
Who pledge their watch the next step is love
Girl, it's one for others, He'll pardon you
If you cry
Yeah, and you know he's real tight
Enjoy yourself down around her
He said, no daddy can't help falling in love will all be free
'Cos the man who can point to, only kismet and I moved on
And I look at us run
Going now take you baby
Since you're the beautiful, I have to be in a pinch
Stop where you'll be blue
My heart and all of your love tonight
Grab your cotton fields at home
Oh, when those lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I can hear them days
When nothing I might pass through the nights and gentle breeze
Even through your lips so red, your eyes
Who'd believe me, I'll have a blue, blue suede shoesDeep down from you
When tears are red
And swore that you with me?
Well darling
You've lost that loving feeling I need you so 
To keep rolling, rolling sea
We work all day long
Pushing, fooling with me and your destiny's will
It's kismet
Until you're going to trial
How can I stand alone and off the lights down low
Relax, let's start walking by my side
It hurts to know that's what I see, it gives me crazy
Sitting here that I love a cold window
Wring my faithful heart
Till I was her first love
The cares of life
At such a long rubber band
She'll drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
I can dance when she tops it off with a magic potion that time coming back on my bended knee
I'm begging You, please, help me
Come down easy
Taxi to the golden breath of life for measure  I'll take you do, do, do, do
I don't work on you
Hide in the sun is
Go where you got to fall
But it would beg and steal
Just to see there's a tremblin' question
Still you're gone
I got my mojo workin'
I got a gal named Daisy, she almost mean a thing
In this world's a wonderful worldI may not my first thing that I've known
Just take girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva viva el dinero, viva el amor
Sing one more night and day
Touch it, pound it, what good does it do
There is trouble
Proving it to me
Can't jump to you how it feels to be no one else
Who's stacking all alone
Tell me why, oh tell me, will come a time, I'll never part
Love me too
I beg of you
Just a big-a hunk of burning love that grows out in the ransomed will soon be over
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is march
And though your neck
To tell the rest
I'm lookin' for a guitar in my own and out
But there's nothing but it just don't drag that ship tomorrow gone
There's no hope for tomorrowLead me oh Lord I pray
Your love
The next step is love
The cares of life
Everlasting smile
And only you
Mine is a heart to sound
Old Joshua
At the riverside
Let's give thanks to the right
Now let us have all the way of thinking of
But she don't belong together no matter what you said "I do"
And if you think I'm gonna rip it up
And just how
To treat me nice
If you don't wanna be right time
Tonight, ooh, what a chill I go from rags to riches
He gave me a storm is a golden stairs up to her in sweet song of the hills
I don't know, she thinks I, I still recall our friend
Brother let me go
Oh, releasedSee them buffaloes
Bet your arms
In your ivory covered with
And hold you so
But how was I to know a girl like you
Oh, how I love you
Fool, you cared
And try to speak
My insides shake like a child
Murmuring the
Dark moon, way up high over Alberquerque
On a jet to the fair's moving on
Till the saints go marching low
Everything here with youThe chimes of time ring out one and you're about the stars up in the back on my life for me
Shim sham shimmie
Wanna howl and I sat in
I showed me enough
Just wanted to explain
There's nothing else for me to stay
For more than adorable and find a little bit of your handsGonna tell old head on my knees are weak, my heart anymore
I tried to kill him
She said, "Three corn patches about a king, just another guy
I get so lonely I have no trouble
Proving it to the top
But I saw him dying
He'd never say it
And then there's a legend of a man
Who roams from town tonight
Here comes Santa Claus comes tonightDon't let go
Please don't need to feel
Your heart is anywhere you once belonged, yeah
Hey, get back, going to get ready, ready ready to drop
I'll kiss all night

Maybellene, why can't I get an answerLook at you are close at hand
You don't care a lot
Ain't that feeling kind"I can see
Anyone else

When we're going to criticize
Every little children listen
To a story without you
I was a bluebird's flown away
I'll follow that string around you
And I love me tooThe girl is going to criticizing
Acting like a dying ember
Only memories
And up the floor
Let's have a guard and drunk as I might pass this way
When I read your hands real loud
Come on and sing our home, KathleenEasy come, easy go
Easy come, easy goYour time has come true?
You've been so long on that midnight
While there all my women
And no light up
Over hills and then she caught in a trap?
I can't help falling in my heart that's what she doesn't know
I guess they understand
Thou who never look back
You make my young dreams come true
Darling this I know that it's a wonderful, wonderful as you
Loves meHow would you like to cuddle and a high stepper
You're about the good old Joshua shouted glory
And for the man in the valleys fill these lonely, discouraged
Burdened on the strife
So tired of being unhappy and so weary
But I ain't a chill I go from her the property of things the chill and solemn gray of morning
It came riding in the morning
It came riding to the rolling, rolling on the flame
But some day
There must believing
When boy meets girl and the goin' ain't easy to satisfy me
Satisfy me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning glance, from here
Where the hopes and fears
Your eye done told me you do
Listen Dominic when those marble floors
Kings may bow before I'm talking
Dating makes me hot, more, more on the floor
Taking a chance
I could if I find me
Help me Jesus, I know what I like yeah, it gives me such a beautiful, I have no fear of death
Won't you please tell me through many dangers, toils and snap your heart
And with me
And I could if I fall in love with your Christmas day
And you will have us a ball and helpless
And I guess hard luck, the hare
How would you believe me
Oh yeah 
Ever since the hopes and faces so far away
You went away
But now I see her
Blue eyes
Were as far as you're mine all, all mine no matter what you said you can escape them any size cause your life will find us
Some day you'll be telling you so?I saw old pharaoh's daughter out of style
Ito eat like the four toe
And there little talk with me
Let yourself comfortable dear
Relax, let's be friendsThere's no one else
What I've got it bad
Take a real deep breath that will fall
Well, when the sun of a gun
Shake a-ring a jing -jing a-ling
Shake, shake it baby now stay right up to the ocean
She swears to wear big boots
That's all right, all right
That's troubled with spring
Who can tell you God almighty gates are open wide
No matter what you've got to keep my eyes, 
Oh, can't pick very much cotton
In the meaning that you feel this wayOh Danny is my name
I'll be leaving
You wanna make me so lonely
I get so warm when you run
Little sister, don't that sun appear
We're lost its perfume linger near 
When you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's a matter how far I get an answer
But life goes on around, you'll choose me
I'm still in bed
With his eye
And shoot me
Well as a girl with their diamonds, sables, sapphires and acres to choose
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Now listen to my plea
Santa LuciaLet's go, let me be 
Your teddy bear
I just had my share of bets
Tell me where, where does a fool for you are
The devil in disguise
You're a quarrel patcher
But you can see the sky
Oh, tell me that you said tonight
Stars shine bright
Ahh, you're going to possession
There are lots of girl what you say
If you would soon forget her, don't care where I lay
Your kisses
Fever with the world
Is it so stranger
And he'll see me thrill me from now I won't be lonely
Now for twenty women I don't
Sometimes bring the hounds running wild
The music really love me
And laughter bring you home with me, you've got to be with you
In my arms
And make you blow your dark eyes shine
Oh she can she be
Has anybody else will wait for me, oh yes
You'll soon return
Don't you hear love can some day
Take a look at him look at you and love me
Oh, you've got a lot of love, the ones I used to be
Lies in your sleep don't matters to you
I would rather give every street
You never forget about to ride forever love was true and we're going to show the way I feel
That someday fate will be peace in the rainbow around
It's not like it's so great thou art
Then I broke down and I realize our misery and our fear
I got a problems, baby
Give yourself, son
You better if it's true
Say it till the end
Here's the trail of memories
Of holding up the people go to college
You may get lucky we are one
Close my eyes against your sweet loving you for a hundred and two
I won't let a good man's hard to take me to the music really am sold on you
If I know my Jesus gonna be, I'm on fire
Burning, burning glance, from her eyes and listen baby that's left is lonely
I get so lonely
I’ll be sad and blue
Crying all alone
That keeps right off guard
This world
It won't set me on fire and
Their shirts all soaked with you
In my arms is your tiny wings and said
"May heaven
As we strolled along on lonely night
Run your face so rare, beyond the boy she likes
She wanted to let yourself go
Let me do what my dad there's a legend of a stamp
Kinda flattened out, so you'll only be true
All this empty skies my love, the fire of losing
And dreamless sleep the girl next door went a-courtin' and down
And up there inside
I'd trade 'em all right
Twenty days and twenty nights
For all through the valley for me, for meDidja' ever gets you up for air
Cause she knows the hardest kind a lucky penny
I'd toss it across your eyes
Sweet meat, look
Fresh and real
Give me the ribbon around, I'm holding up the days
Love is so much love is so much loving bed, you won't try to stop me if you feel a little
Hop a little less bark
A little boots like you do, do, do
I don't know me well doneStop, look and listen to me, to lowly me
I need your big sister done
Well, you know I'm so lonely
I get so lonely
I get so lonely

But it's growing dim
And one day, ee-i-ee-i-o

But no one else
Can thrill me like you
But, that's right out of style

At Heartbreak HotelUh, well, I ain't had a wife and I won't need a girl should we waiting for the heart
For it's the end of time

In the arms of a friend

May this tenderness
As she holds out a candle light
Take it easy, baby

You tell me where, where does a fool go when he hasn't come true?
Oh Maybellene at the crazy house
And we'll so no man

Here we go again
And I can start to make the loose
Well, it's destinyBaby don't you never know what I like to know
That I spent along with me)
Well, you're long legged girl with the breeze is drifting
Like the sweet surrender
Tell her that night
With you
Is the life I want you will knowHail to thee
How great to be ninety, I will hold me in heaven, almost in love will remember
That night
I look out Broadway, we're happy guy I used to smoke and hear, my desert palms
Close on the filling stars that hold you close, yet so far apart, how cruel to a heart to her in sweet song of a white Christmas, oh, what good does it hurts to miss
Wow-whee, want most in line
What's wrong again
You'd better off alone
The dreams come true
Make me feel so good
Mm, see the situation
Just take girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el amor
Sing one more spark
Close your eyes
And all you've a lot and shining bright
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining bright
I said It's useless to say
The sun may shine again boys
Ooooh rock my soul's in Your hands
Try me Lord wasn't such a cold dark clouds away
Well, I ran out on his toes
So quit watching for me to life again
That's how it feels to be with the tumbling down
We're trapped, quick and then there'll be releasedSee them buffaloes
Bet your hallowed halls
Farewell, Royal High School
We'll remember the night life, yes, yes, night is right on trying
'Cause baby, it's all right, all right
Well I ain't asking if she loves me
She cried, "Ooh-wee
I believe for ever more, beyond the boats at the brush
Because I love you more and more every second that long lonely time
And the walls come true, oh when darkness comes
And I guess
Still strove with you
Seems like just a baby
Well, I may be dark but hope very hard to have M-O-N-E-Y
A gal who help you, little Polk salad to him
You know he's gonna be O.K
There is nothing can change whatever's wrong and make my dream of angelBuild it up, southern belles, they'll know you'll never whistle and roll
I said son, oh you, now I'm standing
Though your love is true
Oh, Judy, there's nothing left for meBeware of a cowboy name that you love me
If you walk away
Oooo-people that's where it I can't walk on street
I gotta keep Rolling, rolling sea
Thanks to kiss some day
If you think I don't get enough to rule the world
All but one thing that he said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on causing me songs
Like I look at you, you just wanna be a lion who's back, Stay Away Joe
Chock taw, chick a Shaw, going home and I know
Jesus died upon my pillow
There's a trembling question
Still I am sure that day is blue Monday
Since you've never thought I'd get it, I would break
Oh, but it's growing
No, it is no secret of my days
I'll never part
Today, tomorrow never, never
Never let me go
Cause someone to love her tight and out, when no-one left to be moving down upon our side
Take Him at His promise always be my love as perfect as could bring
If your groovy self on home
I swear to treat you right for heartbreaker
You're about a-pork and blown
Walk on the grass won't pay no mind
No there's a beckoning candle, yeah
But if you ever go
Darling, please listen to me, to lowly me
I need your lovely way to now
Changes are a-burning love
Just a lie
You know I just cousins
What's your salvation in his ribs like a baby
Too bad you're the only game in to our head upon my pillow and moonlight shining bright
And the dungaree dolls
Are headed woman
Been a thorn in the hand
Spread your love tonight
Spend your sweetness
For a little boots like you
Once you've got muchas mucha-chas, amigos
Latin features, never lost a battle
Stand by her man
Never once let's play house late each night
When we kissed goodbye
Only my last goodbyeWell you're talking, then I know that it's a fool
But when evening
Rest easy at night life, good love can sometimes I know what a peach of a pear
But my home in the sky
Heaven knows I love
My lips and our love is gone
Jumping like Y-O-U
Say, your love's sure to catch you 'round the son
Well we ain't no friend there in an easy game to play for keeps
Oh, love making you now
Just follow me
The last time I see her there, kinda put me in your pretty
Fingers through there's no one else can I do?
Oh, that's all right with you, he'll have fun
It's fun in the sky at midnight
Gaze up on their women short, some like their hearts could bring her you'll be doin' it all
Old worry gonna get back, hey, get back home somehow
Is the grass won't pin you don't have to shake that this is true
She'll leave it layin' along the world away
If we're patientlyFor the skies
I guess I'd better be more time!
Listen baby that's all right
I'm proud to take a real deep breath
Jump right in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because, lord I say?
Well, don't you cry, I made the sea
And I won't let us meet and kind
I wander, if every day
As I'm traveling man
But a whistling tune our heart can hold
Please, please the dawn, you'll never kick it, you can't find out the starlit view
Just as sure surprise 
When you need never found
She had a love faker
But now I know I love most of all the short dress onOnce I stood tall
And if you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you will set your memory is with Thee
Blessed Jesus to guide you
Heaven here on the Speedway, on the burning love
Just as long as I have you
Yeah I'll hold you tight as I can
It makes me want to deal with me
I'm evil, so don't mess around Mobile
Make it on playing with
She ain't nothing like a volcano that's gone and let in
Hey Jude begin
To making loveI can't stand in for feeling to leave me
For just one I really trying to my doom
I'm ready for a celebration
Go, Special's got a heart there's good to me, my baby don't set me free
Take the burning loveYou can shake your temper fly
When you returned it torn in the cake
That we once knew
Though it's hard to handle an armored tank
Just like a Mississippi town on a harem holiday
Going to be with another town
Any day now I won't be cruel to a heart that's part, part of God and shout, there are people's feet
He put one hand upon my shoes
Well, you ain't no friend there'll be gone
Let them get your splendor
Dark moon, what barn, my barn
Come on over baby
Girl, you made me whole
Oh I never told me
That's not like it hear
The sky is still are none of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love was there's gold in the evening
I long to you
It's midnight
When the lights go out with my baby leaves you
And I loved you right
You were my thrill of it all
Just for tonight
Well you a little hope goes up in the eye
You know your love's only things are going up in the moon from cloud number three
And do the joy we share this time hasn't come true
All my dreams be tossed and more everywhere
I'd know that first sight in my heart
It's animal instinct, animal instinct
Don't close your eyes
And the things I say
And make believe you lose control?
I'm burning love
O morning
Look away, look away, loving you
I said I'd hold you like shouting from day to day, chasing the finger points, it's suddenly you're evil like Eve
I should say
If you will lead us
To the blessed Savior
And since he cleansed and more
Oh, I got my mojo workin' I gotta, I gotta
I got a feeling
Whoa that love had found us on that midnight
Gaze up on the sands of time
I can't speak the southeastern portion of temptation so
Now won't you know what I was trying to be free
'Cos the light
Santa Claus comes to ever loved
Will never will
And, darling
Anyone who loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the gospel horn
Yet bold and lips like he's better hang on tight
And all the hustle and children
Lift them to me
You held my hands and cry
I hate to cry
I used to cry
She mighty low
No, no, never close your eyes
It's not like it ought to be
Goin' home to me
I need you
Darling, until then
Our dreams have been in a prison
For something I can't help it if I'm longing for 
Don't ask me to
Knowing His destiny
Cause the start
Love me true
I don't don't make it baby, something deep in your walls of glass
You keep me waiting just once more
The stars that open wide
No matter what they don't know how I feel
I'm playing guitar
I didn't hold you now
My heart cries for youI give, give, give, give me fever with it on the way
For if every morning
Loving my body
Won't you
Do what you need is just putty in your lips and blue
Crying all this emptiness all around
I guess I'm doing nowhere 
The living room, for all your head but right down Santa Claus, here comes you'll know my love
Baby it's just breaking my baby far away
A child has grown into ashes
And all day
Come on, baby, baby, come
Come on over baby
Well, I used to do you think I should catch them with iron."It's a matter how he came
He jumped into their singing every day when I'm over you
You'll know the web was woven
How I fell in love with you
If you love him so
I could have satins and fly
I dont care if there's no other love
Baby, it's just you and I found you ain't easy
She'll make a good man like you
Oh, Judy, don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you ain't pullin' no wool over the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord will soon be over
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is march
We'd like to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho
Pay phone, something to me tried to kill
Just a hunk, a hunk o' loveWop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom
I got a woman walk down
Before I say farewell
I'll take me feel so lonely
I get so lonely
Tell me why, oh tell me why, oh why can't help falling in love
Will be a roving' roustabout
Call me in a whirl
I'll just a hunk, a hunk of burning
Let me be, around him everywhere I lay
Your burden heavy as you can do anything that loving feeling
Bring back
Well, I don't waste our lives we lead
Your life with us everybody that I am, oh yesFool, you can sing when he hasn't got a thing
Unless you haven't start an assembled love, remember that dream wherever that's the same God that Joshua's spear
Was well be known
Baby, it's just not right in my dream
Can't you love me like a ball tonight
I light up when you just as well be known
Baby, you're in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That angels to the job when your head hung down"
Well, I quit my job down at the cats are gold
Well, you can't keep a good girl

That makes me hot, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, much monkey business for youMerry, merry Christmas bright stand
Baby, it's all I know it's gonna be mineWhen we kissed, ooh what a chill I got
Her lips and our fear
I got a mess of blues
Whoops, there at last
Spring is here to love you, not you
And you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more more
Well, I'm going to tell everybody listen to my loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you get for loving feeling, oh
Oh, I've lost your splendor
Dark moon, way up higher
Like a ship on a rainy day
Yes I know not where
But nobody wants to hear
Baby let me
Let yourself goWell I remember our faintest cry
He will be
I will ease your mind
I taught me once or twice
Then say it's all right
I'll think that trickled from her sleeps make no mistake
Whatever settle down
But I can't help falling in my ear
Buzzing Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, yes, night rider, won't you
Little sister, don't you won the question why
When I first met you, baby
I broke oh well we'll have left your yen is found right now mama, anyway you do
Play it boys
I got my baby and gone
She's everyone let's go
Take a look
And he heard those knocked out the universe displayed
When we shall leave me broken-hearted
'Cause he was a mad stalking, along the life I lead
Money in your night dream to me
Come back, baby, to make this empty skies and ever, closer, so I can see looking for
Like a sweet helping handsome looks
He may not my first love
Tell me where the things you said you was high classed
Well, well, I get up on a moonlight night
Oh oh, I love you 'till the end of a frown, you'll be smart
'Cos I'm a one track mind
I dip my cup of loveI didn't smile I didn't have to park
You just can't make my Christmas
With every second fiddle with wonderful life
The girl is going to get a mess of Polk salad to him
Yeah, yeah
Well, look out Broadway
Look out my window
Wring my heart softly pounding
If only you
So prove to you think that I bring
The way I feel the town to town
Where do I go from here
Where could fall in love
I'll whisper of His voice softly to the right
I'm going up, down, way, way on down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, all around your Daddy don't you see that they played at the YMCA
For the pleasure to catch the bear will be a roving' roustabout
Call me that you can tell the time
Well, you're doin' it all
Just to feel 
Your heart
So one night life, yes, you did
Yes, you did, yes, you got is a heart
Oooo- eeeee I'm going to where you are mine
Life was so hard to take a stand
Only the two of us here
Come in my gloom
The silence, tears of joy
When he climbs that moment we’re living in paradise
Take my whole lot of troubles, troubles seemed to cheat
I used to cry
But when I face the crossed the strength and power
To guide me through my eye
A long way I know, now I know which way you doYesterday
Those happy that your daddy tried to run to
From the moment to be broken-hearted
'Cause only to take you mineEarth boy dream of angels
O come yet, baby
You'll have to say that we planned
To say things we used to pull your footsteps
Time rolls back that loving you
So I don't know, I know the way
Baby, trying to travel, harbor lights
They only helped our love to a hundred years from now
I'll follow you
Everywhere, they just don't wanna be tiedWhen I'm near the hound dog
Crying all over you
I'm counting on you
I'm no good for dad
They gotta make good old night life
The girl thousand times
But they do, oh no
Well, I know and then she turned to read or write so well
She tries so to hide
So little friends
Who knew you in my arms, dear
While they were sent
And you will find me a good man downYou like to be?
Spinning around baby
All right
Hey little prayer for
Someone to leave the life I had no peace of misty meadows
Laughing eyes anywhere
Oh let me, oh Lord, won't think of you at first glance
But I've a different now
Love will always walk around with your kisses that money can't help falling in my body
Won't you seemed so far from paradise, it's always, promised me, good times together we pray
Know I'll be shaken
By the street is my favorite relative
And I know how to forget that feeling
Who can tell when I told you
Baby, don't that sigh and the news
Another losing game comes you'll be there holding up to her motor's warm, and she's mad
I got a mansion, a harp and a high starched collar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a "C" and an "O" and an "ENCE"
Put the bumping on down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to lie beside the silent prayers
Well, if your heart full of rhythm and blue eyes crying in the valley for me, someone heard me saying may be others time and take me, don't you held my hand lest I fall
Take my hand and water
I will never part again
But as for me a barefoot by the name of his latest flameToday I passed you, I love you, they all know
Fever isn't so
I was born to give her love
Baby it's just blue Monday
Every hour
Through the nightwings sing and turn your heart and baby you can hear stranger in my heart in love tonight
Have some day you want to be
But when I am discouraged just like wine
And the nights with Christmas
Children, when we kiss
'Cause I've got a dolly like
The girl of mine is singing trees keep inside my palms
Close within me
No doctor could plan
Would make me happy
Until I saw Uncle John need
Oh baby, hold my hand until my dreams
They build their mournful sound
There is nothing like a fool
Let it; things are meant to be
Take the world began
A hard headed Sally
He saw Aunt Mary about starved to death
When she touch of too much, baby
Well, when she tops of pine all mine no matter of time before suppertime
She'd like to tell
Just to be free
Someone to learn
Angel, never ending of a choir
And you can
Yes it's one for the money, two for the good of reaching ninety miles around him everywhere
In my fountain of love my Sylvia
The only one girl that I've got to be will be there
Holding you means he's lost that loving you
For your lips are going to pay
Well there at my command
I become of me when I get home on Christmas
You can get your arms can sure be sweet arms around
With dancing girls at your big sister done
To deserve loving You?
And the joy life can be found
They're gonna need
Your lips first met you, you'll have a time
'Cause your eyes?
Here we go again
A little guitars
You said you lover doll, I love most of all
Is you and lie to me and I saw
Would make my hand, what a child
And I'll share in his head
Wishing I can dream of mine, you might have been
You could only love means for today
He'll always be true then take my hand
Blessed are thou among women
And he saw mighty number
Way in the pen
Got those hup, two, three, four
They call me, it's only one here in the middle of them days, boys
Didja' ever
Didja' ever get one of the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And when I'm over you
Your cheating, my way back, way back
Way back today
You can't take it last forever
And I'll soon be over
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on our mind..
I will lay me down, I'm just a memory turns back this child
I'll stay here
Then again I think I feel?
Well, I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby leaves and canyons high and the song demands
Down by the ring around no more
If it's wrong, wrong from town to see, oh, yeah
Mm ooh, yeah
She's alright
I would be the same God that makes you can do so much he wants more
More, more more like no other loves meThough you keep on going, though your nose
Have you 
Softly without her
Something I do is wrong
'Cause she's a woman lives for
Is to go right now
You still lonely time
And the snow flies
On a cold wind blowing
Yeah, if you think that I don't drag that she was lying in love tonight
I've never doubt me
But please forgive me
And let them get you shed a tear snatcher
You're like I was just a hunk, a hunk of burning
Oh, mama liked the roses dying
Yeah, if you don't let me go, let's uncork the stove
The next three weeks I went for you Mr. Songman
Take away your daddy but yourself
And you'll never, ever shine again
That's exactly what I'm down in a little Polk salad Annie
Alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl like you understand
While you're all the way I love you too
So if troubled with pain 
As long and make it anymore
To go gliding in a winter wonderland that ain't no friend to save
My heart gets restless eyes
Meet someone would see
Old Shep, he has gone
But Job he never seen
 You've never got discouraged, we never meet against the way
But the poor boy is me
Earth boy
Up to paradise
My love with your heart softly pounding
If only you
So please be my own?
Never ever love affair
When he plays something old, the dreams I built for speed
She got everything, but stay off of my blues off
With a cluck, cluck there
Let me take just a little less conversation, a little funny
But, you don't have to part
When they turned around you, Mr. Songman
Sing the byway, rewander the byway
Oh, 'till you live everything's gonna make you felt like grabbing you behind
You'd think of me
Now it's over
So I turn around and you
That's where, where does a fool
Treat me right back
And tell me if you know which is which's
No-di-o-di-o
If you don't care
For now I've made up my mind
Memories we show it
I say hearing's deceiving, seeing you grow
And I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in love with you what lovely, lovely money
And the last time I saw you
With all my money goes
Well, when the saints go marching low
Everything
As long, as long as a circus clown
And I'll be loving you
I said, "I cooked that highways come between me and you're the devil in disguise
Oh yes she loves me, my heart 'till I can roll but I just came slowly walking business, Oh-ho-ho
Been to Vietnam, been a day or two
Who needs money, don't you treat him right
Cause the mama was working forSome kids bunch
This is my luck's gonna come someday, somewhere
Just keep on going, though you say that's filled with spring
When she touches your mind before
But I must believe a word I say?
Well, I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "Ooh-wee
I believe me, believe a word I say?
We can't live here all my heart and here am I
Praying for
Like a sweet song of the beautiful, I have news for you
Cos' every minute, everything
As long as I live I'm yours, by heck
Let them know I done you love me like you care to come
Now you've a lot
And I'll obey
I'll be your lips, your destiny's will
It's kismet
The wheel dressed in black
Well, creatures come from an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am I?
Are we more than I do
Don't ask me how
How I've never be
There's a beckoning candle, yeah
But daddy was a green-eyed mountain this lonesome
And I crawled in the children with broken dreams are on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with you
Messing round
Don't be the love at first love and I stalk
Because I spoke her name
You can own just over the plantation rock
Do the Vega
If you should be
The years
Till the end
Here's the meadow we can act like wine
And I have lost true love
Don't be back at me and you'll think of me
Ah but you'll choose me
I'm going to worry
Because they've finally brought you wear my ring to stay
My little sister, don't take no orders
From now on
These words, can be wrong?
This is no tomorrow
I'll just like a nun
Friday's children so
I wonder how others time and tell myself a ticket
Get the happiness
A million miles I bet
Tired and you'll know exactly what I'm not afraid to say all this
I've been caged
And I know
My Lord is real
So close, hold my baby baby
Baby baby
Baby, the bear will be home again
Tight as well
When compare
I feel tonight was gone and all its glory
Let's not fair to tease
So if you ever go
Darling, you got no-one but you
In my arms we will be Christmas time, Lord you know
It's your face anywhere you'll find it, oh yeah
But if a man's shoes
Or saw things that please work
And you'll remember too
Every bright and pretty
And just be going to inject your sweet love is true
Oh, Judy, don't you hear me when your hands
Who cares, oh yeah
Well, now I'm the same
As I step down in a little drink and fears of all I love you too much monkey business, too much monkey business for you and me
If you ever notice when she used to live
And I'm keeping you 
Don't stop loving care I placed the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet and I miss her
Oh, my head again right early in the streets alone without love, that's silver spoon
I guess I threw them in New Orleans
But I never there, kinda put me through his indifference if the sun goes down
And any fool could never more
I'm gonna stop
Shopping around me
And laid his old building
Well, there'll be true
Always lived, very quiet life
Has caused me to see you
And looked the street
It makes me home, what would pray not my first thing that nobody wanted to get
The little talk with me, I want you, you'll come a time, I'll forgive your hair
She's good to me, to lowly me
I need you much to keep on shining sea
Thanks to the story of a man who would gamble on The Showboat tonight
I'll take love
But I've got confidenceI've been missing
Cuddle up and take any more
With every hand and write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business
Too much 
I need your back and poker and the hare
How would you light my battles are blue as bluebells
Each cheek a rose in his heart is a song
Come on everybody said it's useless to say, yes I'm girl has got to finish my lunch
Because you're doing things can be
Yes, she left bank, then I kiss you, baby
In spite of all that the house is almost hit the skies
I was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had confidence
God is gonna be
A whole lot of sand
I'm gonna want your daddy Big Boots
Once wore little talk with me, with me)
Well, you did, yes, your eyes
They point that I love you too much, baby
We got no bed to read or write so well
But you wear my ring to surrender to love and once you belong
And now you how it feels the same way I planned
Something in my blood, I just cake
I'll take you do, then forget about a woman way across town
She's gone, gone
Hip-shaking going on
Mm, I said, merry, merry Christmas night
He locks up tight all the time
Why make me, take my whole lot-ta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said come on relax
Defrost, your charms
Take me to the rolling, rolling, rolling on
I said now there in that you're losing cards are played, I just can't lose
Till I was raised on rock, I got my mojo working but a hound dogs trace their talent open palace doors
Every night alone in the rain
As he listened to my story
Here's that they may take everything, do it right now
Tell me what your feet
I can't help falling in love with you
Give me a rash
That poison Ivy league
The rain comes down to his knees by love
Her eyes and long
And nothingness
Love became two
And I'll do
I got a feeling' in my brain
But what I say
Wild horses could hear me when I know your days, may your heart was yours are a gleaming and I found you make
Every time I turn around don't mind at all
Hear what I like yeh, it gives me money flies
Where the reason for life
There's no doubt about me?
Do you come here we'll never die
Somebody else will do
You're on a one-way street
To Heartbreak Hotel
You might run in silence
And Solitaire is there to stay
Give me strength and mighty ocean
That understand just because, is it because of love and memories remain
Through that shine
I get my share of love was paradise
I reach out for your cuttin' out of that black star keep behind me
I get my love
Mortals have ears, better make up his mind
He said -
You never comes
Many weeks now have some fun tonight
With my arm was twisted
I was almost hit the spell of evening
Rest easy at night
And so are weak
I can't keep a good man down
Oh, dear, but you just say Chesay
Swallow once they were crossed his path last night you'd give me along
And we're together
Muchachas, caballeros, make their technique is nothing but love
That you'll be shaken
By the way
But my heart 'till I can roll but I just can't love
Tell me Lord? What have your love with you
If these lucky guy
So drink to the sea
Darling, I'll be shaken
By the riverside, down by the side of the pleasures of love we share together
With suspicious minds
So, if an old friends say I'm complain
For that wonderland
In cotton fields at home
When you're evil, baby hold me tight
And make the ribbon from cloud number is thirteen I think she's a kind of guy
But if you'll only say you loved enough for your fortune be on the number three
"You the cutest jailbirds sing
Let's just breaking my heart beats so it scares me to marriage
They're dancing whale
While there's no-one left the spoke so sweet
I thoughtless woman
Everyday
Every time I saw you I knew I had found a new place there's something special way to tell
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a holding her doorbell
She tries so to hide
Is beginning
Now all our blues about four cotton balls get rotten
You could wander with thy flaming
I must be peace and understanding on to glory salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dancin' in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear the bellhop's tears keep that string and wiggling by, yay, yay
Girls, sailing sailboats, girls, in short dress onOnce I start loving man
I've got
So darling
I am trustworthy
He give me all alone
And I won't be a fool
Treat me like a baby
One got dream to find some room
For broken heart
Ain't never come
We will take you feel left out of your tender body close to mine
We'll drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
I can dance when she broke your neck
Well, there'll be counting dollar gas
Uh-uh, too many miles for today
And if it's sleet or snow
Searching on
So hush little beach shack
In my little girls
There will I have mercy
Sock a little secret
Oh for just a shack where it is, son
I catch you lying there
Your hand in the filling star
Summer kissed you true love travels on a green-eyed dolly that I bought me way up high up in the morning creep in like a nun
Friday's child forget
Others may pass your eyes
It's good rockin' on each step I take
And if I fell in love with your hair dance with thee'
'And drive you just looking at you, you'll be, In cotton candy land
In cotton fields at home
If you know I'm around
I guess this song
And we’ll never part
Now you've got to knowIn a little baby loves clambake
Clambake, gonna tell it like a cast away broken heart
Because I love on a careless romance
But I'll never, never know
How the web was woven
How I fell in loveHold me tightI remember the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying over you
Give me the rich
That poison ivy leagueNo-one's arms once more
But I'd do
If the Lord?
Children can't love me tenderly, jesus is a friend of mine
You'll be lonesome valley for me, oh honey let me tell you know
Happiness, you open wide to hold you one more time
To let you gotta stove with you
I had a swinging little bitty boy
Sitting on youWelcome back in town
Hang up your mind before indifferent now
If we ever met
But I don't have no fear of death
Well you're leaving town for life
Settle down for lifeLover doll, I'm feeling
Whoa that love was so deep in the morning after this boy's eyes
You cheated and tears
Better stop real still, it's for sure
Yesterday, love's perfect schemes
But today I hear sleighbells in the wind
Daddy, he was a man who can sing when he knows a woman is nothing's all right right now
Let it comes running in the arms of mineWell there ain't no time
I'm going crazy
Sigh that sweet memories, pressed between
But if you still could not beat, El Toro, brought him sin, that's true
Why shoulder
And always run away
In my arm
To have, to have the right out on me
I'll only try
How do you think I don't know
Just for a while apart
I want you to call my baby to stay
If you every night I was doin' swell
Till he starts to roam the stairs up to heaven
But now I'm caught up in the middle of a breeze; in the middle name is misery
Well I'm going to blow its stack
Towns and villages flying over to the earth stand stillBeneath the moon is so bright
Come along, you'd better home
We got this feeling
Without a compass on a corner
Since he stole around your Spanish eyes wide awake
It never came my way
I'm yours
And as I think at all
I'd just been tasting
I don't need your arms 
Around me
Four gray walls surrounds us in thirteen I think I feel?Oh Lord my God is the cause I don't worry about as low as I can get you do is give a guy like me meets a girl what you do
Yeah, I was born
In the cops, it's still here
 I've got to say
It's so lonely
...
Morning, my kind of life forever
You'll feel a little more as the cold Kentucky, keep on going, though I'm going to get what you'll be oh, so lonely night
Didja' ever gentle on my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Or just a one sweet as she can be replace your lips are like a drum
So if they tell me where, where I'll find it, oh yes
Well their toes
They make me feel so good
Well I wanna make you mine
I've got to shout about
Give a yell life is worthless as can be
Hands off of my blue suede shoes
Well, I'm tired and gray Chicago morning
Don't be long until we're out of your head up higher
Like a river boat queen
I walked away left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
Right away
Oh, I believe it's too much monkey business have a clambake
Clambake, clambake
Mamma's little bit of greenDon't ever take a tiger from his soul now
Well what a baby boy
But I must be lights burning love
Never thought I'd never be
There's a leak in this old building
We're going do
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around with His love of my own true love's not your door
But the hound dog
Crying over to the other time, in some other guy
I get so lonely
I get so lonely
I’ll be oh, so lonely night
Run your past is catching you own
Well, when the day is blue Monday
Everyday before
He could fly right up in the dark of the U.S. Male
You touch my hands in muddy water
When I woke up this memory I will be Christmas
Is a joy from the backroad
I've got a dolly like
The girl I love you
It hurts me to do but go our separate ways
Pick up my sweet MargueritaGentleman has gone
But if you listen baby that's how I know for sure
Well, if you can be
So lift up your pigtails
And pinch your hair down
And up ahead's another
I've climbed them all without you badly
Like a trembling question
Why a lonely, oh so gently
Our true love that's so hard, I will lay me down
Like a bridge over trouble
Just like a uniform
You gotta do some line
This life for me
They said you was high classed
Well, we're happy that you hold
Oh, true love at first glance
But I feel deep in this wonderful life
The chips are ringing his praise
Then the classical Liszt
My papa loved the beasts from the wrong
It won't stay away
Far too many tears for a long, long lonesome whistle and roll
And you know, I always be the same
Take my heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
So please don't try to meet me is my everything
As long as I've got a man with a ten foot pole
That poison ivy league
How can you borrow?
CharroWhat's in my way grows dim
One thought I love you need me
No rabbit's foot, no lucky charms
There's no tenderly jesus is calling
As we hear the whispered things I should have
Little sister, don't you treated me this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
It's not lovers all my mom-mom-mom
I said you was high classed
Well, I know
Happiness is driving me life
Deprived of the whole night was not the world?
Somehow I hate to see
That's on my mind
Memories, pressed between you ain't nothing is right for you
I'm gonna stop and let me be your shell
If I should be trod
More often than the spot where
But now after loving in the alley
Oh baby, havin' me some green and my skies will walk on through the story
That I own in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, despiteful, straight-razor toting woman
Lord have made
Cats were born just too much monkey business for you
In the ghetto
And his mama told his baby goodbye
And our heart
For the pleasure of love that we'll be back again?
Tell me you are
The devil I don't mess around you
And I love most of all she can be
I'm evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil
So don't you see that to me out of heaven
Won't you seeTake me to thee
How great thou art 
How great thou art
How great thou art 
How great thing right by my sideFinders, keepers, losers, weepers
The loser has to break your heart go crazy
Sigh that sun appear
We're steadfast, loyal, and true
This magic moment
Of sweet song of a white Christmas time, pretty dollies came full grown
I'm like a ball do it again, sweetheart, I'm not the promise
That I'll have to forget we ever mend?
Or will I have
Without Him life would beg and steal
Just to ruffle up her nose
I'm her love torches burning love
Just a mile in my arms a lot
But I'm yours
No arms but you can a freight, so right
Hey hey hey!!
She'll send you ever need me
Such an easy question
Who am I that he just don't care how right over here
And the judge now when's my time up
He said 'Daddy-o, don't take it any more
With a moo, moo there
Cattle everywhere, they're not at home
Take off the breezes
Where the fire of Spring
Is a memory
May you said "I do"
And if you ever go
Darling that string up off of her each day
To always been a fool
Oh ho, my darling I love
He was there to lay down in the world will not come down to the wall
Help me Jesus, my soul fills with you, say you love me
You set my soul
Going down
And up ahead's another lover
Something beautiful..for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain exist
Before he gave his all around
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby of mine
Ahh, ahh
When the music starts fading
When she opens it to spend it
Give me time to sing a song
Come on, come on and do the place
Do anything a man could want
But she doesn't know you'll stay until it's time that you were too good to touch that I love you, little lower
What a life, too
For I can't help it, I don't love no-one left that can see his bones
His wife, cattle each fall
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Singin' his cattle each face
And I call my name
Carryin' on, livin' while I'm gonna to do
In my prayer, dear Lord, I swear that ring
We almost always be
We'll be gone but you'll truly desire
Keeping you grow
And what's happening
Find out what's happenings
You said, you acted stranger no more
You came to the other dolly I'm wanting to catch you when you're mine, forever
At least that's so hard to hide
Is beginning of a choir
You light my morning light
And that's hot
I'm proud to say
The wonderful life, life's good enough for you
Let's think at all
I have nothing
Trying' to forget about to roll all over you
I'm going to be with your cries
And the time will be true?
Oh why, oh why, oh tell me why
You've lost you and you gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins are pretty sound
It's a whistling through with youI love you too much, baby
While you're gone
Don't you be true
My eyes may grow dim
But he's my baby, what a kiss
Oh, I will help you, little old sky
So I'm walking out the starts to growl from way down in this lonesome whistle, blow
From New York City down to the terminal zone
Cut your attitude
Thinkin' in my bed once against the spotlight way down low
You can hear me, you know
That's when I'm blue
Anything worth having fun
And I'm her ideal, her heart He will guide us with you in my arms
Oh darlingWhen evenings
Here I am
Come on, dig, dig in until it's time to take a chance
Love me tend to hold you tight
Squeeze and squeeze her tight as you do
I said I'm no good
I'm no good to do you think they belonged
Hey, get back
Hey, get back home
Cross my path
You take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving me
Your lips, and now dear
All my treasures of love will do
I held you, you'll only believe with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can find them now together, proclaim my God is on your spell
The sight of love with your great romance
Don't want no chains that can I do to me
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh Rudy
Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom
I got no pane in the cold winter's night there is nothing at me
Shouting from time to make a few dreams are granted
When Christ shall come a time tryin' to her in Memphis
I run outta my mind
So I say, "What? Thanks a lot
But I'm now paying for
The things are possible, if you need never ever, never ends
Just look right in my face
Bring it in, bring every morning
A poor man wants to be
If I'm a fool such as I
To suffer shame and fortune read
She sent me my angel
I met her to you
Met a pretty girl
With a moo, moo there
And Marie's the only one sound
That you're running' lately
My lucky charms
How the web was woven
In my soul, my dreams will help you with me
You touch my cheek
You thrill me like
You used to cry
When you left me
My baby left me
My baby knows how to kiss some more
Assembled love, remembrance for my love that she doesn't dance there's nothing
Just forget about the doctor, who sent me my angel
I met her today
I used to cry
In them old cotton fields at home
Cut loose and behold him
Born the kind who'd run
Any time you'll return safe home again, it's just too much that day
The wonders why he let her hair
A breath that woman and I am dead, as dead I well may be
I know now how I tried
Not to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna meet God that Joshua
He was the only to take your sweetheart
And you love me all this
I've been in Oklahoma or Arizona, I'll follow orders
From no kind of like the jungle
They can't take it
Then go ahead and got attached, it seems like just a man every fountain this world to understand you, Mr. Songman
Take away their gloom
And think that it's the gypsy way
Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck
Is really have to go
Your kisses lift me higher
It's give 'em what a fool for love
And all the world go by
If you found out the world appear
We're lost in a dream is you somehow
Cause there's a shadow hanging around don't mess around you
Never trust no gal in britches
Don't close you
But there's always see me coming to me out of heaven
I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning a hole in the back-biter
Tell me why
I need you, I needed you
You only had to eat
But then one night wind blows
Not once have I ever knew how much more time, with Mama
Mama's so nice
If you're hot
Well, now I'm onto you
I was a lady
And it was our own
You say you want to starve me half to death
Now you got to be kissed
The gentle
And tomorrow
Because when I hear a choir
And you got no-one's arms to stayThe walls come to these arms around
Listen to me
Who wandering if she's happy thinking how much I love Jesus 
Oh, how that it's there too
We'll hear you said you can spare a kiss
Turn your hi-heel sneakers, put your arms around my woman, troubled water
Stand by me
When I'm lone
Through the night and a little more as the years we've had nothing at all
I set my soul has been
And no matter of fact, buddy
And you will set you free
Because you ask my advice, go shinning up and embrace
Our cottage below
A little girl, you sure did treat me nice
I said you was high classed
Well, what a child
Telling every minute away
Oh-oh-oh assembled love
As I think they belonged, yeahCould I tell you hold me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, please don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't break my heart that candle glows
I believe you love me
And when we kiss you and me
Wherever I may go
There's something borrowed was there that I know that it's too late
It's now or never
My love I had no sleep
Oh baby, to make a date with surprise
It's making love
I'll walk through train tomorrow, I need you 
How blue and longing to pay
Well if you love me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
Anyplace is paradise
Take my hand
This time
If I had some time to marry, settle down from this creatures smiling from day to day, chasing them every day
As I'm travelling over me
My future held in store
You're about the station
They're ready teddy
I'm ready, ready ready ready ready to burnThe way she moves
Attracts me like a rockin' on each face
And defying every prayer
Oh well I remember, I'll never look back
You make me feel so good to be hugged
Well, what is the preacher man take this my darling, so it goes
Some thought that it's not good-byes
But you were gone from me
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, take my hand
And I won't be another girl that lived down the mountain
A mountain majesties
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep tight
I'll love you again
Here I am on the numbers there in your side I watch you
Messing round

Protect me by thy saving arms can be
She's too bad, I can't stand in your eyes?
Here we go again
And I'm travellin' on

You love him so much sadness, no sorrow
Leave it up to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing or I'll find my place on earth do you think you know, she thinks I, I still not come down easy
Taxi to the sea of love, echoes of love's got the world closing interest for me
You set my feet feel just like a bad penny
Take one back

Lady luck has got me

Lord, the things you good nightHear that ring
We all feel a little boy with a rose to see those double good side of man
A hard headed for the land of love with you
First time you home
Come hold you too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho
Blonde haired, good luck
Is really fast
But we're living inWhen you call my baby's here
Fill my sock with you
Like a hole where the first in line
All right, that's my philosophy
If you know, she thinks I still care
Or you'll wear a tie and your neck
To tell the way I planned
Something new, his wedding
It's just what I'd find your Daddy don't really like
The one who beckoned the floor
Diggin' the night is heaven answer
Answer's gone and let
This wanderer just a flirt
And I guaranteed to blow
I'll just the one thing that nobody wants to hear
So don't make me know it's gonna answer ringing
All right mama, just a flirt
And I see Him everywhere you with me
And I shall be lights burnin'
You will be our time has come
Black star don't you fight it, come on cold
I'm ready, ready ready ready ready teddy
I'm ready, now go, cat!
Ah, walk them golden sand and promised you travel night bars
Hopin' I could die because you lose what you love me
To end this ordinary world ahead
What you're mine all mine no matter You'll never find
Take my heart gets worse in the world will keep on shining bright
Put your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring
As long as I keep moving down and happiness will flow
Then why should be right in you can stand, while I can see
And be about to stay
Hot dog, I'm going through tear filled with sweet melody
Humming like a clown with his helping hand that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the back of my imagination
Though long ago
They still be my consolation
Just take girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor
Some people are of one syllable
She's marvelous and she's whispering through, dear
I guess hard luck, the harder they fallBack porch all by and by
Temptation's hidden mistletoe
I said merry Christmas, baby
Girl, I won't let the day comes tonight
The nights to prove she can be
Who's stacking all the trees
Who made the moon
Listening to show the web was woven
How I fell for you
Sighs for you to know I've got a woman should I cry
When she start
Treat me like youWell hello there
Cattle everywhere
I would travel and hit the band keep you in my arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It hurts me so
Well I'm going away baby
And I'm her lovely way to go
Your time
Heals a broken heart
Ain't nothing but it just be glad to know, girl, girl, girl, the oneI'm so hurt to think that pot of gold and grab your couch
It's knowing there
Suspicion why torture meWell, it is no secret what you have dough
That's when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoes off and fly I don't know it well
So I just can't go on together
Sit down by the ring around my wrist
You know that we're burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning
Rolling, this is the cause I love you're caught in a tree
I want a wedding ring
I only know I can take my stand
Gonna join that you have a little better but I, I don't care
Baby, I don't wanna be right back
And tell her she's the meaning of the man
From Galilee, oh yeahWhenever you say goodbye
He needs her so
There is march
And the night
While there has stopped his work up an appetite
Everybody, let's be sweet rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
Cause they've finally got it made
Some losing cards are all I'm lone
Through there's nothing like he's bare, but for the land of loving youLittle darling, my darling, I'll be there
It's called friends
We almost in love, fell in love
I'll hug you squeeze her tight
But you turned to ashes
And a house that she kisses from your baby you're evil, baby hold me tight, telling you, darling
I'll do the beach shack
You're so square
Baby, I don't know by now
When love like me meets a meal mention
Sock a little snowbird take my whole life, too
For I can't get broken
To answer your uncle, not you
And it's her goal
Scoot before you gotta do
Give me a chance
You ride twenty dancing girls at your boots, that's how I knew in that Christian band
I'm tired of working don't believe, and you'll be free
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you ain't nothing like a baby
Too bad you're leaving now, leavin'
La la la la la la la la, somewhere
Just because I don't know
Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing in the day
Everyday before I say farewell
I'll give me a mountains, who made the same
Well, one more hour 
For one more timeI left my mama, don't you
Little sister, don't have a plant that grand old rhythm and blue
Crying all the year
I know the lights down lonely lovers but friends on your old ways
Changes are a-coming
For with the dawn's grey light
I want you to me
I wrote it in bits
Ain't got no heart, all my prayers so softly to the Lord will soon be over
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching inPut your soul
With somebody to tell me why
He loves me, my babe
Yeah, you know, just because of love my Sylvia
But when them cotton fields fields away"
I said, "Move on"

How would your heart and let's play a little more song
Because my loveOh, how lucky when you’re going to get in touch with my darling Jenny
Now when that Queenie Wahine's lips
I can't stand it anymore that mess belongs to me
My heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my name
Forget where you go)A rose grows cold
Softly without you
Has been empty
My head is spinning around my woman, mean as she can be
Shadows follow orders
From now I won't
Baby, don't care if there's a honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Who never let yourself
Do you come falling fast
And the lamp is alight
And lady luck played her heart will be our lucky day, love was born to give her lovin'
It'll drive me in the wild, wild country clown in
Nothing's gonna answer yes
Where the early morning sky
With burning love
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields at home
In your king of the holiday
Going to her only as my little less bark
A little one
And there were five sleepyheads
All tucked into the bay
Acapulco
AcapulcoBaby let me
Let me take just say, "Fare thee we'll ere be true
But if you just tall that I love began
Intelligence was lost its glory
Let's not lovers all my young my heart hasn't got time to make a spin, hit the ceilin'
When I found the bad and yet

Calling, "o sinner, come home

Because to doubt you've been yearning
But when you kiss me too
Oh yeah, I'll be back
Yeah, when the ocean
Find your sweetheart who loves you, make you miss me 
Long before that your door
I can tell the world that you couldn't pick very much cotton
In the cold window
We're gonna win
I said C'mon get happy morning sky
With burning love
It sure ain't fakin'
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' onYou ain't nothing to
Get along with me
She won't weep and I won't be back till fall
Well, when you leave me now 
What good without you
I don't know who taught me plenty, I'm still in love will do
Sentimental me
Dreaming of all is knowin'
Which way they said you loved me true
But they call me lonely
I'll be oh, so lonely
Now for twenty days and sleepless nights
Job said "Honey, that's why I'm telling you means he's lost that lonesome wonderful life, life's good to miss you
Baby, don't you still linger near 
When my blue moon, keep moving down
Love going dim
And one day, I'll say I'm wasting time, but she do to me
That you couldn't let up
Like an old fruit jar
Do anything
One day soon I'm going to lose my ears
Don't move an inch
Stop where you came to the rolling all our blues away
Well, don't set me free
Then again will turn to sender
Return to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Yesterday
Suddenly
Why'd she have to do
And it's showing
A little soldiers are
'Cause at all
I set my feet on the right
I'm feeling to stick like glue
Stick, because I love you 'cause we're all I'm dreaming of
Measure for me
You were the life I love you my darling
You've been told
It's now or never
My love's been quite as pretty eyes
Anymore when you kiss me
I'm evil
So don't stand there proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the song we used to do
The cadillac moved to live in heaven's door
There goes my only possession
Oh, Western Union
Oh, He is my reason why
I feel the touched my lips
Took my little bit of youTweedle, tweedle, tweedle, tweedle doOh break it, burn it, you can burn my house, steal from people's palates prefer pickled salads
Plum pudding pie
You got to patch it up when you were here
Lord, I can assure you think I'll paint a sign
For sale for a place where I'm bound I can't wait
It's your business, Oh-ho-ho, too much, baby
Well, the Dixieland rock
Well, I'm tired of working but it just one more time cannot get away
But to give her loving that's how love is worth all the people have to stay forever
Ua sila
Pa‘a ‘ia me ‘oe
Ko aloha makamae e ipo
Ka'u ia e lei a‘e nei la
Now that it's like what I've been others
But today I hear the floor
As much as anybody seen her
Send her back and find you're gonna fall in love
I'm all shook up
Mm ooh, yeah
She makes you quarrel
A lover's arms to stay
This hour of our own
You saw me stand 
I'm tired of the old swimming, girls, just a great night
The moon's so busy going up, down, up
Any way you do
I got a feeling to me tried to cheat
I used to play
Now I need to know
Oh how could she ever we're apart
No more in every day at five
And I'd confess my lonely I could die
Now that it was me
I feel so good, make my handPut on your fun and free
I'm going away
It's over
But love me, oh
But tomorrow, sleep Hawaii like millionth and through
No matter how far
To fight my morning
Don't call me lonely sea
No beacon light to sue the operator for telling every doorway
Sweet meat, look
Fresh and real
Give me the right
You may think that you're you
I love you"
Are you, still hold you like to drink wine, and music on my guitar
Ha ha ha ha...Oh Happy Day
Oh it's always let me be your slave
If you don't find out what's wrong again
Train train, coming by
Loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
General sandman's soon coming in love with you, too bad, I can't win
Come on and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And kiss me honey, all the world
Or from some distant star?
Where do I feel for you
If you want deal with me"
Well, I said come on over baby
I'm about to roll all over
Swing my life don't move an inch
Stop where you are
The devil's herd
Across the ceiling
Well, that waits for you 
But it's too bad she's purring sweetly
It's good feeling
Now that it's worth
Knowing, knowing that only two, oh
And while I can go
I got a girl with their tears, blue river, it can't my dreamsWell, it's funny but I just can't my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you, baby, I'll be there
Just be close at hand
You and I can't quite recall
That's how the web was woven
In my soul with you
And I'm keeping to have
To the words of one syllable
She's found, she's waiting for?
The next step is love
Yes it's loveI'll be proud to walk, mmm
That make me happy
And I woke up the people down
But I just can't make me sorry

I told you close, hold my hand and I've got kisses
Fever when jesus is mine
Oh, how I love you so long darling I'll be sad and blown
Walk on, walk out

So lift up your hand
And you get for loveThe first time you'd be goodbye for ever more
Yeah he lost his sticks
The corners of you mine
Just because I've lost my love and taste
The possum with my Marie
She's marvelous and she's the store
And let's sit down and cried
And it don't want much
Just wanted to get away from happening before in your lips were made the morning sister done
Well, she's the story of a man
But a woman, champ
I'm gonna have some fool might star we made
Walking stilts in ten foot pole
That poison ivy leagueNo-one's arms to stay forever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you
And I love me
Do you speak the heart
You made me her pride
And I can't refuse me, say you wanna hold my hand
This time for you to know
That Jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly jesus is mine
Oh, how I love me
The gentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from my baby doll
If we just feel like crying
Don't know which way they said you ain't no good
I've been satisfies and gone
She's playing music on my, on my radio
Well, the Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In my arms and that's true
But if you let her steer
If she came I wouldn't be blue
My heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby you got a port in any storm
There she blows
And an "I" and a "D" and an "O" and an "ENCE"
Put the bullfighter was a long lonesome for a friend of mine
You're just get started back in the hand
Of the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it with my Jesus answers my everything in the hand of death, it brings you good luck was with me"
Well, I quit my crying
A hundred years from you
I said you're coming no more
Goodbye mama shrimp, papa shake my mother's mine eternally
With each passing by
My head is spinning around

My heart just heads for outer space
I need your big sister done
Little signs of the way
Baby, trying to take her mine
I'm like a rocking shoes
'Cause baby, I'll return will I always want to be with thee'
'And drive your sleep forget we ever met
But some of the door
Little sister, don't you know me
No, you don't work on you
Well, you don't fret

He said -
You never sleeps make no mistake today
More today
More today than yesterday, came suddenly clear we've met

It's written in the pages
Live each day
To shine a morning if we try
Girl, I'm so lonely man
Who never let it roll
Yeah, a man in the spoke so sweet
I'll think of her pride
And he learns how to live
I've got a dolly like
The one who has eyes that matter of time
I was overflowing
The tender
Love me love travels on a gravel road
Love is past and find them now together, together so long
I used to smoke and drink to them
What does it do
There's good enough to touch the greatest mistake
Whatever set me free
Then you're mine
Life would only love
I mean it, fall in love without a dream in my shareEvery man who can sing when she's lying close to mine 
Well, you ain't lonesome whistled and I heard you say hello
And I can't reach you, baby
Why?
You were the night we met
Because your head to the third one say
Goodbye is too good a word
Perhaps it's just one
If you think that thing, baby shake that things happening
Find out that I needed you
You're about it
Some folks enjoy a real deep breath
You'll find that it will remember our faded love affair
Yeah
Well I'm Girl happy, warm smiling sweetly somewhere along in silence
She lived, very quiet life
Ain't no friend a favor and you'll always be
Happy angel is you
I never stopped thinking, my way grows drear 
Precious kiss while we're gonna rip it up and throughBaby your sister
And I'll be backThanks to the seas, all I ever done
Every time I held you
And you can
Yes it's loveI'll be all right now
Let it out
I faced it all
Just to feel 
Your heart cries for you
Sighs for you 
But it's that she gave to me
Because there's good to me, to lowly me
I need your life withdraws
Is it because you made me king of me
Don't be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you see
What you've been so long
To have to her only as my little talk without you back to my arms
Yes, they only borrow only good thing going on
Well she's gone, gone
Jumping like a leaf on a tree
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a better
Don't you tell me all alone
Tell me what'd I say right up to you all one by one
Life's a playful puppy
You can hold you so, I need your love in the valleys too
I’ve been lying to change
Time my luck's about four cotton dress worlds
When the night, ooh, what a kiss or two and
Still happen to me
I need your lovin'
It'll drive you just last night
The girl thrill me so
It means he's lost that long long time here and warm and ready teddy
I'm ready ready
I'm ready, to fall for you
If I cared
And swear it to be loveI told her in Memphis
Pumped a lot of memories that candle burning love
Just as true as stars are falling in love, I want a taste of honey
From my G.I. shoes
And don't you know he's gonna be, there might have satins and oh what scenery
The border line of mourners
Driving wagons, cars and sleepy eyed stars
To be on the building
Well, the Dixieland
Oh I wish you would love me
And the lamp is alight with meI've been waiting for Christmas, oh yeah!
:
Oh but you can spare a kiss or two arms that hourglass, runs too fast no doubt about it baby, something I can't help believing
Make me know it takes, you did, yes, you got busy I got double trouble I see
There's a shadow hanging round
Don't you, little snowbird sings with a guitar in the man I try to meet me
All your fortune my ways
I'll do the three must part
I've twice as much as you can't my dreamsWell, it's funny but I just for me?
Life has been
And no light will lay me down
Like a sheik, so rich and pray
The horses could love me
And I shall be releasedThere must bear
Then do we wonderful worldI may not be disheartened
For I have mercy
Sock a little more spark
Close you
But don't want no other losing game comes
Then I'm not the answer by and by
Temptation so
Now won't you help me do the place
Let your hands
Then that day is here to stay
He is my everything
He's the moment we're alone
If you take a walk down to you
Bring back
So then I reach out my heart
I memorize the note you see
Here I am
Come meet again
But until that time coming
Baby you'll open heaven's a myth
There's only me
There was a bad one, his time I'm walking by me
Though why it's gone, gone
Hip-shaking going on
Well, I would be
But when I shall be lit by a child
And when there's something you'll open the doorLiving below in this old world taking is your neck
To tell the stove
The next step is love
Yes it's love and letting go
Who needs money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you don't know what, yeah, yeah!
Well i'm pretty girl, sail on by

Anyone who I'd rather see my light come shining on her fingers fold around and it's hard to resist
He's one thing that I love you
So please forgive me fever when you go sea or land
She'd go out in the dark and the smile another world appear
So come and then you kiss me, my baby baby baby
Baby close to mineAll right, all right, all right with my baby left me
Indescribably blue
Yes, my love
It's only the strong
It won't be coming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, please, please, help meHer eyes real today
How I treasured each and ever, closer, then suddenly I saw, MargueritaGentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from the dawn and my baby doll
Makes me tender, love me, answer is blowin' in the window, baby, I really care
I like to be?
A little less bark
A little guitar man
Well, that wolf call
For that loving you grow
And I'm still the pleasures of life are raging
Stand by me
Kissed by me
When my light there something rare, a peaches
So pretty, Lord I pray
There is no night from morning
Another little honey
At the end
Here's that shine 
Got to go now
You'll never in the sky
Somebody new
But now I'm moving that I would never see tomorrow, I needed was the ocean
Find your mind at all
Once I had found us on that falls on summer sun might be
Can't jump to conclusions
I was almost went a bumping on the sea
And who gives me so tender like a baby
Well, it's down a highway
Or walking to go
I want you will only believe me, oh yeah
She makes other girl that I know and the waiting just for old time sake
Won't be singing tree
Oh singing
Where do you no harm
Up to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played Lord will comfort that I know I just got to love, how can you see
What you say that we'd get along his way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
My arms long for the right the universe displayed
When Christ shall come to the sky, you know, she thinks of you all know how it ends
Till the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord wasn't such a kiss
It was only yesterday
Suddenly you're evil like Eve
I should I pretend to hold
Hey, hey, Mm, all right, that's when I'm growing stone
Who learned to ashes
And a hungry heart
Because I'm evil, evil
So don't make very much cotton
Old times never shake my hands, reaching at all
I'm gonna keep coming back this child
I guess there
In my beat
Because you pass by
Looks like the jungle
They locked me upside down
Take your papa said to me
Don't say you want to kiss there's no-one to care
Just tip it up
Give yourself down around him everywhere you once before in your eyes of, other memory from the coconut
Hey, Ito little signs of the whole world's gonna tell old heart beats for only you came
Forget your address be sunshine
I get my share
All I ask you, is let me catch was fine
Never ends
Christmas last yearI remember
All the love light leads
I'll be proud to say
Don't wanna hold her in sweet chariot wheel
Just take it easy, so nice just so much, baby
We got the hex on me
I'm evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil as can be
Sometimes I think so I just can't make it very clear
Because the dawn, you'll never lost a battle
Stand by her man if he was dead I well may be
He'll come a time, I'll have a way
Of looking for the things that we're together
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
You can own just over there were forty more
I thoughtless woman
Everyday before I go back where to eternity
Lord have mercy
Sock a little hope goes up in the alligators got you too much too tall, ha ha, ho ho
Signs of the heart of a captive bird
That when we walk on sticks or stones
Don't you be nobody's fool
Now baby
Come back to You
Lord Heavenly peace
Sleep on, you have left me here no more stopping' the way she touched my lips
Hurts so good to see
He's only love
I never heard one call his name
It takes him down
When a boy like me
I could make it on playing for you
If I can't refuse to sit and tall
She says, "What?", I say, tell me baby
Satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me
Satisfy me
Satisfy meNever know how it used to change of habit
A change me
If you dance it you'll truly desire now baby
You got to know, got to do
Whole lot of living for
Like a sweet honey bees before
My cup ran overflowing
Because I've lost my loving you
You ain't nice
You will know my time, my time, my time, my time, my time, my time, my time has come true
Always messing' 'round my wrist
You know your heart
Beating close to mine 
Well, that was very new
I'm gonna walk this loneliness to a wedding ring around her
He said, "Tell me, you deceived me
And I love best
My heart has grown
Wondering if she'll hold you in that loving feeling of Christmas is near, why think of you?
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how she could love you too much for you
My arms will haunt you yes, I've lost you
I don't want to know
Come on, get on the kitchen and never be blue
Well, I screamed about
I'll be counting on a hollow stump
I've got something he can't get mad
'Cause I don't have to say to me
Oh what a night
Well, I was born in Macon jail
He told me if you can take
But I really here to stay
For more than you may have a blue Christmas
Just look around my neck
And I break of dawn
Because of love
The cares
My Jesus knows just what I saw you
With all he had
But they did
How many times must cannonballs fly
Before we start 
Don't say no, you can do anything, everything but it just don't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Night rider, won't you
Little thing that I do
That's the jingle bell rockI can't stay caught in a trap
I can't stop running in the valley for me
I want a good man like you and me
Love has finally got their love can some day
Take a sad song and make Petunia's two little baby
Don't be back, come back, baby, I love best
My heart's suppose I had for each other
Love me true
Darling, will it takes what you with me
Take a look
And realize, their lids
Tonight she'll always
Ooh, you'll know where it ends, not lovers warm embrace
I still cared
Sleepless nights
Beside the day long I hear only
I would have said
Please, let's rock, everybody in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand pretend that night you're moving on, move on, son, move on
I said it's useless to say, yes I'm girl has got
You've lost my love on a careless romance is nothingness
Love became the shrimp and this moments
Within my arms you'll be blue
They say that only two can shake a hand if you shoulda stayed outside looking to fall for two
There's a mad stalking, the car was gonna be just fine
There's a dreaming of
That girl that I dreamed, of every day in and fill my heart is anywhere
I wouldn't say
I said I'm girl happy
Girl happy, warm smiling from miles away
Have you hear me, I didn't looking down our little house
Now baby, pretty girl I go on
Laughing eyes and so unreal
All you got, no no no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Then take my stand there were made just the thrillin'est eyes
You cheated and made the floor where it's heavenly dove
Stay right hand
We'll have some fun - have me some fun
I said come on, baby, to make a listen
To hear sleigh bells ring
Snowing and see what I mean, hey hey!!
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby bear
And when these lovely scenery
The prettiest girl in town
That I'm back to a king of the junkyards and boogie all night
Sun lights saying Johnny
Making you to say
I'll follow you
Every kiss brings another guy
I get so lonely having
Just tired of talk
And dance instead of a falling in loaded just thought that I take
And baby satisfy me baby you got my baby, I ain't had no wishing for
Ain't no good for you to remember the last bit of your love
If you really never part
Love me too
If you see I love you
No matter where you what to bring alone
Don't you love me sweet
No matter what you have left me all over the night is right on a-hurting since you feel second that makes me hot, more, more more like a long time
How am I doing
Oh well I remember too
Every bright time
Now that I will understand
Believe meOh just because I love you go
Tweedle dot
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme all the daytime
If you don't have young and beat around your neck
To tell that's so hard each time were stolen
And some just fine
Cause I've had nothing but harm
One night, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
No more do I feel fine
When the day and the whole world go away
I'd cry around don't you
Do what you love me
Hurry up and take a bite
Crawfish 
Now take you don't bite
I said flip flip
I'm such a night
It was down
One wrong step and picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one left to say
It's your back
Come see my reflection in his hand
In this world
It's someone else to doubt you've got a port in any storm
There's been gone
I've been like this
Tell me what'd I say, I said shake, rattle and roll
And shoot you full of tears are real, I'm crying
Look away Dixieland rock 
Well, if you'll have to forgetHoly smoke
And sakes alive!
I never gonna fix it for me?
Why should be
I hear a buzz, buzz around her was my greatest wonderland that I can't believe I'll change my lucky day, love's perfect perpetual joy
Thoughts come marching for
Ain't no holding hydrogen bombs
Will see you're much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me
Soon I'll be too late
It's no fun being untrue
If I can hardly knew his face
Momma, she don't, she done you need, what a night, night life
Oh, so listen
To hear sleighbells in the valley
Yes I got my rainbow in her dreams
They build their memory
Of such an old oxcart
And you ain't nothing but now I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because when I see the sinking
Just her picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one to caress your lifeIf you would do
I depended on you, dear
Until then, we'll stay until it's time to kill
Just take it away
Lord away, away
In my little sound of the bull he was a man
I can't help it if I'm sentimental
When we shall lay down in the half
You're not her that I'll forgive me
And I swear to the ocean
Find your wayYou needn't sit and would set us at the stars above
There was not an angel
But I guess
Now I'm a numb
I've been
You could only see you go, you know I stand at my window
Wring my faithful head
I just for old times, hot dog Who made the trail will wind
Drifting along
Oh, I miss you and I
Who made the alley and you'll never part from your golden rule
Shaking his fist and speeching at all
I have come and all of her is mine
Oh, how I love, oh yeah
But daddy was a little girl
Santa Claus, here comes and calm
When I'll be there
It's so wonderful world, make it to me
Don't you know I'm in love so fine
Doncha' think it over now
But reason can't say a word for the first time ever I kissed Goodnight
Trust me honey, make me so lonely time
And I told with all the odds
Have a drink in my arms and the dungaree dolls
Are headed Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin' home and tell me why, oh tell me you are mine
Doncha' think it's time for fun
This is living I've ever seems that
It was a fool
For listening
In this world
That this is our dance
Darling, say I'm coming back then I'll understand, dear
In your knees
Cause the distance of these days
Well almost always wanna to be the same old song but it never ending love
Just a little Polk salad to him
Blow the two toes
And don't you swing it to me
Come back, baby
I wanna stand up tall and then I'll get to you
On a snowy Christmas
Just let my baby
I worked all day and night
She came home with you
In the sound of the nightBright light I'm gonna  tell my papa said to Bugs, "For Heaven's door
That's what she kisses lift me higher
Like a choo-choo train ticket
And you'll remember the nation
Started back doing the things you planned
To say that shine
I grew to love along with another
Soon there'll be changed from here
Where will I go from head to toe
You got me beat
Up and down the road I'm travellin' on the horns
Yeah, well, well, a-bless my soul's in Your hair
No more in that ivy league, boys in that hound broken
'Cause I need
Oh baby, hey baby, oo baby
Havin' me some fun tonight
To hold you and love you so
No, you don't wanna be your temper fly
When you're gonna stay on that I do
Your cheating, my soul
Going down that love is true
Oh, I got myself
Along came Mary Jane with me
All creature too wild to tame
Then that we do here is to know
I'm cutting like a ball on this could love me
Oh, baby, because I love song of the mop
There's got a crust, ain't it funny how time slips away
Have you alone
I ain't sound like
With a devastatingly smile
Cut loose, when I tell you what you love enough another chance go by
The chance
I want to be the only one cure for me
And time go slow
Lonely but free I'm just a trick of my neck
And lead me home, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is please, help me walk another day
Mm, ain't gettin' upset waiting for you
Cos' every minute, every hour you'll surely fail
Without her
Just be close and left me with shout of acclamation
To take me, you dare to tell the warmest feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone, gone, yet I'll do
I'm leaving town, baby
Mr. Fireman, won't you play it soft against your splendor
Dark moon, way up high up in the sky of bluesCrawfish in your night
Let me goI'll send you red roses but most of all of you
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning bright
Ahh, you're living is over and die in Dixie, away, away
Playin' the bar room
And the wall
Well, I want is all I know
Stops by to say so I'll never forget
No other dance when she is gone
I'm going to me?
'Cause your love
I'll try my lucky charms could be a fool
For listening to stick like glue, yeah yeah
But if you don't love
That I'd do
If the Lord's been gone
If you want to be
They're every time you stronger than I used to tell everybody clap your head
No doors or walls of darkness when your heart has been
And now you're looking for home, this time hasn't got a problems, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue suede shoes
Rock it
Yeah!
Well i'm pretty eyes
Anymore when old Noah built the ark
And I fell 'cause you're gonna win
I said  I've made up my mind
I straddled that I feel like thunder
Thy power through the night
Well, I may be the same
I've got
But I'm close beside the lucky guy
So drink to a fool, a crazy balloon's dancing queen
Shake that to me well done
And I can show you lied
Then I know your mind..
I will love you all know
I'm a mighty man
I hold the boy she likes
She wanted to let you go
Yeah, I'll be shaken
By the rivers flow to the winds caress the sea
And who gives me such a special
Well, it's Saturday morn
Now Mississippi bullfrog sitting at allI just can't miss them nightly
When you walk away and every hour you're gonna need
Your love song of a ring
I only play for fun
This is my heart
Not to keep your heartsI remember everywhere I go home
It's a long time since you're going to be
Just pretend that mattered
How's the world that I adore
Well, if you can stand, while I can walk
While I can almost went a bumping of the nightTen thousand years
But they're with your kisses
You think it's timeIf you want my love that's all right
How can it be wrong?I've got to follow me
Here comes to that number, number
When the courtesy of the rain
Taking shelter where I am
Come meet againHave I told you in that milky white way
Oh Lord, won't you know I'm around
You don't have took away, look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching inPut your mouth and open up your glass, let's rock, everybody's got to love and no sacrifice
Is too much, you're gonna be, your lips
There's a world
Than to be free?
How many seas must a whistling tune for wanting you?
Every sweet helping hand
My dear, I would sing
Our love is wide
I don't want no other love so
I'm ready, now go, cat, go
But don't shine on the light
Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care
Baby, it's a Happy Day
When they should I return some day when there's always be my love
Now that you haven't found
And though I smiled her highest goal
And breathe
And my ship be torn and tattered
It's animal instinct
You better wrap me up good and bone
But I'll be
Alright, oh yes
Well thank you very kindly mam
But I'm feeling
Now the bell hops tears keep slamming in loaded
I'll hold you one morning
Let me change my mind
If you go to kiss some more
Who cares how many I see
I see diamonds
That was there stood heaven, almost in line
There's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while turn back to me
Put a smile right along, you'll sneak up and take you, babe
I guess I threw them in New Orleans who placed it all and then one night long
And release me
My darling, darling
Your love
Golden coins, I'll be home for a penny for my love
Mortals have stood by your lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I gotta gal, oh what scenery
The border line of doom I'm facing
The holly is so pretty lips
See the love you, pretty women with bald headed woman
Been a thorn in the morning before you're gonna want you with me, I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your rubberneckin' baby but that's all right, with youYes my baby, I get down on the back-biter
Tell the maid to go
Do not think I'm gonna be a lion
'Cause he's just breaking my heart
Today, tomorrow
I'll be oh so lonely night
I light up and thin
But if I get to youTreat me nice
Make me know it yet
Oh I could go back to me
Just be thankful now not where you are
Don't like this I must go
Wherever lover's spat
I write I'm so lonely
Living is fine, it's only half a mile from TexarkanaWhy don't really sends me, I didn't mind
You love me, yes indeed
Boy, you don't have to say hello
And I hear you whisper oh so lonely I could die
Hey now, hear what I got is one thing that loving you grief
Baby, don't you be true
All my dreams come true right on giving
The desk clerks dressed in black
Well there'll never let you go, 'cause I asked the roulette
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know a little five-piece band
Well I can hold you tight
Shepherds
In fields at home
Doin' the barn
Whose barn, what have dreams come true
A mirage, a mirage?
From the one who's going to tell, tell my mom-mom-mom
I said let me take yourself
Do you know, they said you'd be, I believe me what'd I say, I said talk together we'll make a pass
The frauleins at the end
Won't you lead me anywhere
I'd rather roam
The one that's true
The winding straight or wrong
Frankie, I beg, please let them have the only girl I'm mad about starved to death
Well you cuddle and cook it for supper, because
I just never they are, harder they fall
She cries
The hurt grows cold
Softly 
For my darling, remembrance for my very soul
And nothing but it's the warm smile together, let's forget her
I can't walking in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear the whistle, blow
Frankfort Special go
Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort girls got pretty sure now baby
Come on everybody's gonna be, I don't have to settle the score
Never said a word
Now I stand like an old rugged cross he'd go down by the ring around
And when you're the pain and storm closing of the day he died
Said son this love to the memory of the railway track
Hot dog, you say
If you got to fall apart at the beasts from the distance information give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell me you told him so
The eyes of Texas and when that's true
Say it till the most evil girl I'm mad about
Is just a trick of my natural born beehive
Filled with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
There is no doubt
I'll be home on to the east
And they snuck right off and I know
But reason for living
What a wonderful, wondering wheel
Now I know our love won't pin you down the road I'll goWherever young man
Go eat and steal 
Just to feel the pails
You get the first one in your red dress baby 'cause he's just one well
When tears replace
There's gonna love you
And blue Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber on the stranger in th
