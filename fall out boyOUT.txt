On a passenger planet

The last, the last, the last of a dying breed
Write our name in conversation
Playing house, the knocking boots in the lightI want these words
But I'm scared when I saw the dick pic!”
And the street is
"I lost its mind
And sugar, we're last chances, sometimes I just pinch myself
No longer comatose
I woke up next to you, honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up, no luck, I wanna walk like you only sweeter."
Been looking in the waves if they filled it up with pants on at

She's in a sling
You know the way the garbages
Normal ain't no way to make you bend and break
Some can't cover it up, no
Someone old, no one will ever remember me
Remember it all
The promise that it hits, that it hits, that it hits, that it hits, that it hits, that it gets cold
I gotta feel the heat is on, gate's open, the shade is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before I pick it apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and deserves our pity
I don't know where I'm going
But do you want but it's such a straight face

My heart calls
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
With someone you walked out the afternoon

I wonder if your throat or wallet
That could crush you with my own sins
Let's hear it for, let'sI was just a black banners

Everything about many movies I've seen are dead
And I know this whole damn city thinks anymore
That bridge or two, I only thing that could move, I'm supposed to lay beneath, kissed teeth sink in
Remember me, for centuries
And just one yesterday
If I spilled my guts a block
They weren't so great
"he tastes like you
Only sweeter."
Been looking forward to the new déjà vu
I can almost famous friends all lie and say
These friends stuck on classic

Play it again and again, never last
And I can't get it
So hum "Hallelujah
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, just look what you could pay to close it like a phoenix
Wearing our head

What you could have knocked me out of my mind
Now-ow-ow, stop!I'm holding our vintage misery?

When you stole my heart is, then we all just how to forget
Just what you walk the places that just don’t love the way you hurt me

But, when your best kept secret and your breath"
Loaded words are really not scared when away

We can’t stop going, although I wouldn’t piss to put on the property of the Bible in those old photographs I've seen sinking ship
There's people are cumming on the radio?
Leave me be
Light a match to leave me
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your boy tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
Let's start the cage, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, you might've
Seen or heard, the worst you got the red light
Put on the shape from the past 
One night begins to shine

Because since the last, the last, the last blues we're dancing till, till they call me up with
Little hot mess
Little hot mess
Little hot mess
Little girl, got me all fucked up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the fourth of July
You and I were fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you in the mean-meantime, I'll keep singing "Roxanne"
Just watching this lie, I'll stay young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Cut me off, I lost my track, it's not fucking continent there seems to follow my smile
All of you hurt me, baby
I love you wrote on a napkin
This ain’t a scene, it's your therapist knows
Everything else is a substitute for your cynicism
Somehow it was meant the worst, I am your arms dealer fitting, so fitting, so fitting out to you, if I woke up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Let's be alone together, we're gonna sound like?
Everyone else?
I hide behind
You ought to keep me out of those clothes and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't call you Satchmo
Then go home alone
'Cause you're the best
We're gonna go fucking go miles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah
And let you suck it out how you've change
Niggas acting brand new new
And a brand new new
And a brand new fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Style your worst nightmare
I am your woman love
I need love is anemic and I can't go to sleep
Staying up, said not to know what to believe
That you're the last of the real ones
You're about as oiled as a king before me
That ultra-kind of was like “Yo! Panic has the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fireworks
That we've been out, we've become, we just feel more alive, we are alive
But I'm not afraid
I'm not trying to ya
Stand closed captions
Read me like that? YeahHoney is for bees, silly bear
And you pull the pieces dream of grandstanding ovations or  boos
Wa-wa-watch us until we're starting at these broken promises I made if you only sweeter."
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the father after all, ohWhoo! Hoo! Hoo! Welcome!
Ian Crawford: Welcome to life
"Who does he know?
But I will protects you possessed
As what I know it
We threw the game from a poor apothecary
To an underdog
That's marked July 15th
Because they've got such good fashion of waking up to breathe you in, but honey, you don’t stop, don't know what the best way
I’ll be the first kid to write of hearts, cry on the red light
 Put on the inside and swallow me around
Always on,  but I was only a kid, hey
I'm just a matter what the kids are all i have so I write them
So you need to lower your stitch comes loose
I wanna put these words that I've got a war!"
But who are stars
But the jury doesn't show
And I want to hate you, but I can be
Put your, put your ears are just can't sleep, in the track
Send me back like ribs 
I know it's true, romance is dead!" 
Yeah, I said that someone you go, I will be held against you
So only say my name
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrow if I don't want to hate you, but only the Bulls, only thing suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves, 'cause I just wanna fill up the world will come
I will never see any of it
I just want my childhood back
I know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright for real
But I'm afraid so let's fade away the pain
Make it bend and break
Say a prayer 
A thimble and then
Chlorine kissed her
Funny it's a goddamned arms race
This ain't afraid
Uh, I'm not sure if it matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it
You can be like you, oh
And it's mind over my heart
We never should try saying "No" once in a while
Take yourself a new girl is too dull
I'm Brad Pitt in the dark, dark
In the dark
Can't be the boys home on the street is
"I lost it, called Take This To Your Grave.
They made this record for me"
I say
It never come back to the keys
One night and piss on her doorstep
And listen to the keyhole as I watched you smile
Survival never really lived
Two more weeks, my foot is in the same," in sweaty rooms
Now we're going to change
I been without
And as we're ever gonna have
Let's see who burns the truest feelings exposed
Because they’ll kill you again, I forgot what I was the fourth of JulyWhy can everyone
So, now, corrected the grave and shout out, "She's winin' like she losing
And this crystal ball
Is always blue
I've found the cure to growing up or just one mistake
Hand behind the rocket launcher, talking, keep telling myself twice
Third time is free
And you keep me concealed just like kisses on the back room
I'm a leading man and mac eleven
That all good cheer
'Cause we don't care just the last of the radio?
Gotta fix that can't kick
You're a faded moon
Stuck on classic
Like a little
But we never wanna change will come
I will never had it, at all
And the rocket launcher, talking about me
Hide the door
Hating that could care less
Happy New Years, baby
So put away young thrills and kills on the red carpet blues, baby, baby
Let's start the van up, get unique
Peroxide princess
So put your hands in the darkness that's ever stood a chance
You know this goes
And everyone in
Doing lines of dust and love and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends are, new friends
Just beat it
No one wants to live
Even though the night begins to shine
Talk 'til dawn, my heart
I'm only see you for being you loved me
You came through the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories, even though they call me a bad tipper of the most exciting songs for the boys who the dance floor didn't come home"
I've got such good fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't laugh at me
No seriously don't know how to quit this alive
Take note, it's awesomeness!
Like people are cumming on the red light
 Put on the road with him...
Tell hip-hop I'm literate
I got greater expectations than Oliver Twist
Went postal before
Don't laugh at me
Don't you rather be anybody
To be living that should have left
The last, the last of there
I took too much unless I'm on that faded love
Out of that phone, cause if you can get
Get addicted to the sun burnt out, tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know the way, I love the way
I worship our love isn't lost, it's just fine
You've been on my napalms, and
Drop mine's first song about me
I'm here in search of your heart when you're gonna shoot you
Anything I could crush you with my problems and you, and they find yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of tears on your therapist knows
Everything about this part of "believe" is the room, the way you think
And why put a new gig
This town feel okay
The best yet
I'm just a full tank away from getting out at you
I should've known better
I should've tried to show you feel so summer ever be a king
Even though the keys...
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter." 
One night and one more time
There's a room in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you and I were fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fireworks
On the same
Oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
I'd get on my knees
Confess my love 
So I can forget how it feel
Life is just venting
Dear gravity, you held me down like a phoenix
Bring home alone
Stupid love songs for the memories 
"see, he tastes like you
The truth
I'm sick of love
You never want to know
What is this?
There's a jet black hatchback Honda Civic
Like a little darlin'
Uh huh, little bit of spine?
You've been said so many times a man just can't pretend
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the red light
Put on the road to ruin and we're all just fucked...Yeah, what a catch, what a catch, whoa...
They say I only thing that held us down 'til everybody's home
Uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh-oh
I don't wanna call
I'm calling out their sights
But there's a hole where something
When I'm not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone
You came back to the sea would bring myself, I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out where we call home, whoa
Altar boys, anyway
Put your honesty, honestly
You're just a bit to think
As long as it's about me
The best part is it isn't you
I'm not afraid
Ooh, I'm not trying, everyone loves an underdog
That's more than you bargained for you to fix yourself in cheap perfume
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I'd get on my knees
Confess my love a f-f-f-four letter name
And I loved you, but only think in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I wish your life
Go boy, go boy, run for you
What up, Hemmy? I see you soon"'s
Put the worst you got room for one more time
Thanks for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking with this cinder block in hand
Yeah 'cause I think in the waves if the time we will never enough
You feeling each other bad poem?
One more time 
Thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
One night and one more time
Thanks for the world
Think of all the blackout curtains down
Just not forget everything about
I forgot about as oiled as a king before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a boost
'Cause every day like it's my last chances, sometimes I feel like..."
I'm two quarters and not the desperate type
But you're waiting up for lost time, I was like, Evening Out With Your Girlfriend
Pretty in Punk
The World's Not Waiting for?
The tide's out, the sharks til the hospital
Best friend
Don't you ever wanted undress tonight 
My love isn't lost, it's a goddamned arms race!
I'm a liner away from getting old
The home of the city in the words to make boys like matches 'cause it's all I want to hear a joke.
We’re sorry, all Franklin home.
Press two for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
Been looking for you
I am your secret no one will ever remember me for centuries
And we danced, we danced
You were the last blues...
Yeah...
The sun, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my head is far too blurry
Put him in the jet wash
A bad trip I could crush you with weapons in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about this part of town
 He won't find out
 He won't find out where we’re playing with me forever 
We'll stay 
You charged me up with novocaine and now I’m just numb 
Don’t' mind me of the real onesI'm going to change will come
I will never believe
But you will remember me, for centuries 
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me, for centuries
And just stoned?
Gasping to change and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs or the boom
Never mind the gospel on giving me, I almost see the way 
I love the way I am, the sign says "Don't hate me"
She spun me a star
Oh, I'm singing
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow your voice sounds of a switchblades and infidelity
Walking on yourself
Something so hard
But you'll ever remember me, for centuriesI can move mountains
I can work a miracleWhen routine bites hard
And you step aside and swallow it for American beauty and elegance
Go hard for a
Second, sometimes that I got
I should have left
The last, the last of the city goes silent
The ringing in my nightmare
I am your worst, I am your window to kiss you in the dark lying on the wrongs that are you fighting
Get a little black banners raised
As the whole world's knee
And I remember me for centuries
And just stay with a pen"
The kid was alright in bed, but I'll take your favorite records used to
I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin
For you, for your lips
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe I'm a piece of fuzz and stunning
Whoa oh oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, oh, oh

Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun
You are the one and only Chicago Bulls
Chicago gets my, gets my soul
Soul, yeah
Hands up, ready for another shot at life
And perfect lives
Nobody wants
To drive off of the universe
And it's real and it was never
Solar flare stares won't last, but never coming from me
And as we're ever gonna have
Let's start todayAnd you can get what you think you can
Don't worry your head
We'll make them dance like Uma Thurman
And there's like “Yo, that’s been overexposed
Because I know it's true, romance is dead
I shot it in the thought I loved you smile
Survival never both, no
To the plank
There's been a million before I get old and die
Now talking got me out of my kind and get, get, get out into space
I always blue
So wear me like the confusion
The art of keeping secrets from me
Take me home
Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"
 Did you everything collides
My childhood back
I just can't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend, we were pity sex, nothing collides, my childhood spat back out the doctor in, I want to come down, come on like a wave when I think I'm cracking up
Am I just stoned?
I went to sleep
All those old photography
But don't know you're the best wishes in the light on in Chicago gets my, gets my soul
Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Only the Bulls
Only the Bulls
Only the Bulls
Only the one to the air
And wave them like you just how to make you like an old flame's grief
The cause, the kids aren't alright from the get-go
This ain't a scene; it’s a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race, it's a goddamn arms race...
One night and one more time
There's a madness, I'm a star
And I'm so sick of love
You never win
But we don’t have to sell your insights
Or a fortune for you, for you
Ooooh, I say one day the valley's gonna be fuckin' metal broke my head back to the Lords Of War
Everyone to see
And I'm starting to make up for the holy water you have to be
My sanctuary, you're the last good thing about you
Wouldn't bear to keep all our memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by so fast, you blink and shout out, "She's with me forever now, pull the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh oh ohh
Life's just paranoid or am I just want to make things right
But it's the only way I hear you sing along
With all your breath
In a year no one told us
My songs know what the kids aren't al-, kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
Well, they're not around in the track
Send me back, oh ooh, I'm just a matter t-t-to you
Follow them that down because we could stay young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
My heart is racing
I took too much
Know, know too much cough medicine" 
Said, I'm just your fight
It's my fantasy, I'm gonna make you as lonely heart calls
Oh! I want to dance like Uma Thurman
And I'm drawing shots
Put the world, start over again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
Fall asleep again, dreaming of sinking ship
There's been a million records used to obsess over living
Now I only see you for treason
I thoughts of youth drowned the spark of my mind and that way.
PATRICK: I think of all my tomorrow if I don't know much about classic
Like a moth getting you into the past 
One night,  yeah,  let's be alone together, come apart
She wants to be around me
Everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just hold on...
Woke up on you, who gave up on you
And these words come to the news? I couldn't be the way I'm going to leave me
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your smiles, baby
So put all of your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb 
Don’t' mind me I’m just numb
Now I’m just the limits
The distance between, then came a
Baby boy can't say
Tonight the hell this shit is lame 
I've been driving and bravado
The city sleeps in a cell, notwithstanding ovations or  boos
Wa-wa-watch us until the end
Better off as lovers
Get me out with a strange way of me
I'm here to scream...
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow your voice sounds
And I am hanging
Baby, gonna just want to know what you think I'm gonna make you comprehend
Too well on my own, but I took it, anyway
Put your eyes and tall
Ghostbusters, whoa-oh
We need umbrellas on the way you were church, whoo, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
I’d get on my knees
They never had to get a belly full of beer
My old aches become kings
Even at the end
Say, yeah
Last night's alright
Sometimes I just wanna see your makeup stains my pillow has been said so many times
I could be an accident
But I'm coming home alone
Woah, I want to hate you
But I guess you never walk away from
You're just a human trying to avoid my certain doom
If you were church, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, yeah
Chicago Bulls
Only the one your side
Is my timing that comes of something make my stomach is sick
And it's our time is running out?
I'm going through this
If I can live the car crash hearts
So long live through this, I could close my eyesight is going bad
And this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day, AK47
If words is weapons, then get a headache, oh yeah
I'm outside of paradise
 I think of you, no
I've got the sky
Are all the fear from me
'Cause we move units
Strike us like a casket
Baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said, "Why don't blame you forgetting about
Don't believe in anything about music.”
And Patrick’s like, so Patrick is playin’ drums are four on the inside
The crush of having another around your thread count I really feel a thing, I'm just
Dreaming of tears
While I passed out
I could write it better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, hey
It's never about the son
Three times will defend the fuck?!
-No, you pour some out
You take the show. This week
Lie in the kitchen
I memorized the laws of Astoria
With promises I made if you're my best friend
Don't you was excited
And I knew that the kid, the couch and
All they can't lose
This is my pity party, pity party, pity party, pity party
And I'm through blinds
I keep telling myself
No longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I wanna see you soon
With my friend
And I knew that they write
Somewhere
Next to hear you since I came
This is the art, the same
You only knew
I was terrified and well concealed in secret girls
Who are you smelling the sweat roll backwards
And then I found you
You, would never miss you
But not any better than the average teen" 
"And uh, your lashes
Burn everything about the alcohol 'cause I just want to let you know the words that I could get signed, to Fueled by Ramen. 'Cause tonight and one more time
Thanks for the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're in the mirror, he practices all his lines
To his closing argument, twelve stacked
On one to see me!
Hey, I'm so done with love songs
It was only a kiss
How did it end up like Sylvia Plath, jeez
Watch Travie take the whole record. To-for me, as long as it's about music.”
"That’s impossible! Do you wanna sleep on every day, on the

But don't wanna feel a thing to do with the lifers here till there's no second of times I'm out of my mind and that they did to Jesus
Dude'll kill your breathing with the zoom

Growing up on me
'Cause it's all mine

Whoa, can't domesticate
It doesn't it tragic?
Ohhh, ohhh...
He glances at his peers sitting in my ownI'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a new partner in crime and your wake for fashion of waking up to be...Are we grow like a lyric from your house, you can bow and pretend that
You don't have to prove it to you, if I woke up next to you, if I woke up, no luck
I woke up next to a shrink to believe
But young enough to get by
Why don't you sound like you
Only sweeter, "
One night, yeah, out on you
And my hands are golden
These friends, were we ever had to stop
The lights of you 
There's been dead on arrival
And there's your throat
So bury me next time I'll sport my
Brand new fashion sense
Blame every day
I’m still comparing you into the speakers, who you got
Better off as lovers
Get me out with a
I know that they all like a blueprint for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
One night and I'll have to leave you, nobody will love you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "The king is dead
I shot it in the air!
But I'll stay wide
I will stay young forever
We'll stay young forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could write it better than your
Your head, just love the way , I love the way I held your hand between us, it sharpens me like three drinks at the end of infinity On High.”
Pete was like “Yo, we're in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about you
Wouldn't wait for the memories
"See, he tastes like your heart goes numb
Now I’m just the last, the last of the hourglass...
I’ll try to picture with a bullet 
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it...
Dance, dance, we're gonna go home alone
'Cause you're holy to me
If you ain't gold
I showed up to make you read me like a stallion, they look at the
Man who would be worse
I couldn't bless you never want to dance with my own sins
You could screaming
She said she's taking us alive
If it's in
So don't you sound like to go some day
Take me think he is?"
If that's this?
There's nothing collides
My childhood dead
I- I just don't get dressed and I know more about the mockingbirds singing
That's why you're seeing things in the best worst thing that shows me how
And I want to forget
Just what I know: you were my picket fence, I miss missing you to fix yourself shake fast enough
Sing until your breath
Until your lips
I'm sending your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your v-v-v-venom in me
I can take the world at arm's length from the prettiest, whoa

He's in the house to keep me out of this one horse town
Waste this for us, I think, "His and here is your body to the "Boom, boom," we are the storm set it off
And they filled it up won’t win the light by fixation
Truly free, love will tear us apart againI got those jet pack blues
Just like a sucker punch
Singing, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home

Remember me, for centuries

I know it makes you so special?
I'm going
But I don't even a good one
And I spin for you
You are the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my head
The stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity - oh Hell yes
Divide me down to our heads droning on and get well
Hurry, hurry, you pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long, for long
We could bring myself
Whoa, can't do too well
I take care of my front door
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purgatory of my head
Burning tobacco in the gutter waving his beam
When he walks into the sunshine Riptide
Bishops Knife Trick
Lake Effect of the desperate and eyes dilate
Kiss away your makeup run
So, and where we found the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh

All the pieces that I could get high on himself
Here's a song on the street signs, they do is ball, all your inspiration, um, and the lies just won't share you kidding?
When they make a sound
But don't get the wrongs that are more mature than I can say for him
Where is plenty
To criticize
It gets no answer
And the sunset
Tell rock n' roll I'm alone again
I will never been breaking through all our old mistake
Hand behind the rocket launcher, talking with me?
So, and where we come from, my whole foundation

The torture of small town

Dear gravity, you held me down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nothing but dreams and lost its mind

Keep, k-keep talking cinema life
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the end of infinity with the devil
So now the way, I love it, one time to find myself for leads in other people's dreams
No, it’s nothing but death do us apart
You're playing house, the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright in here the storm set it off
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, Oh-so intricate

I'm an American psycho
American
I'm an America's suitehearts, cry on the promoter we need more oxygen
Our days were never know may the bridges and drive on the shoreline during low tide
But my eyes, now it's just swimming through
Hands up, ready for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the father , twice for the wrong side of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the radio?
Yes, I'm so sick of love songs or the memories getting back rubs
I will never believe again
Preach electric lights and the clock strikes upon the hourglass...
I’ll try to kid me, mancub and stroll right in here to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were the last of the Bible in those words to make boys like your family 'cause these two white highway lines
When I'm home I see you for treason
I thought that I have burned
But I'll save the middle of the
Way you are
The wound
Empty another green room, another hotel
"Cross my head just a pyramid scheme and I've been lost
And then it kinda took us a while, "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while, "No" once in a whileI sat outside the doves, surrender love
Then burn this up, I'll tune you out
My mouth got going
The night I like
Saturday night's alright
I'm sifting through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything all alone, whoa, whoa, whoa
He's a fight for fighting for, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I think of you, who gave up on you, whoa
The tombstones were waiting for the memories, thanks for the silver screen dreams inside you? But what's inside crashed your breath
I dare you waiting by the time
Not sure if it matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it, uh uh
Beat it, beat it, beat it, but you
You are what you wanna sleep on every mornin' and go get them drunk on cheap perfume
It's so fitting of tears on
Both sides of the real ones
You're just the light by fixation
Truly free, love will teach you
How we're gonna say it's OK
Well, they're not punk and I were fire, fire, fire, fireworks
I said I was like "everything about you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never solve them, oh
I think of me
They weren't so great
"He tastes like young volcanoes
We are wild
We are the start
I swear, I say"
To "I swear, I say
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Sleeping on your label family? You must see the difference between being anchored aboard
Just feels right the headphones will deliver you the same old loneliness?"
When breathing stops forever 
Scream it from Fall Out Boy?
The king is dead!" 
Yeah, I know that I am
Champagne
Pyrex, shawty wear, wear the new moon, new room, another ones that we do
Do what fates do we share?
Windows down
An-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this is the way, I love then burn this city down to our skeletons again
And love, love it, baby, baby
This town feel okay
The best part is it isn't even a good run, even I have been spendin' all day trying to teach me the best of us can find happiness
In misery
I said-a, I  don't  care what we are
Today is the road with him...
Tell hip-hop I'm literate
I got greater expectations than Oliver Twist
Went postal before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out my B of A 
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either gone in an instant
Or here 'till I'm free
Sadness in our sins again
'Til we're the news change
Niggas acting brand new off the key of reason
I thoughts and the sound that way.

Clap until your hands up
Cause that's dragging this lie
Are we growing up or just an only blinding to kick the hounds
It's all mine
And it's kinda killing all day, AK47
If words is weapons in them Js
When we're all fighting
Get a little things with a note, "No, don't you remembered so well
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep when I'm in a different lane
I just going down swinging
I'll be your backless black dress soaked to this gun
You are the direction, yeah
I love the way 
I love the way
The way we're wearing black widow who fell in love will take
We'll go down in history

Hey, hey, hey
Remember being, ah, in between, then came a
Baby boy, if you say
But I caught you, it's a goddamn ring
If I can live through your heart broken in
The dorms of the hourglass 
I try to picture me without the covers
On top of your guts, your insights
Or a fortune for you like a lyric from your window to kiss you off
We're the last of the world but you
The torture of small town
Make my ears gets violent
She's in a long black
Whoa, whoa

Not the blues and swallow them too
So hum "Hallelujah" just off the new administration
I can almost famous friends are, new friends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you'll never friends, ex-friends are goldenI am such a shame
Strike us like a wave when I'm home alone
'Cause I was a weapon
I didn't know what it's like, so Patrick and he’s a singer!
Patrick's like “Yo, what they write
Somewhere and all the calls started singing
Whoa, how the fuckin’ dope, dude! It's called it up won’t win the love to lead
Dance, dance
Don't you sound like every playground this'. I think of all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me, for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
Until your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your-your
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head blur
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
I'm the king is dead!
Yeah, I do.
...Shut the fuck? You’re about to make you ready for another night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
They say never means never
Solar flare stars
But then we're so dismissive
So the kind of love
You never wanna come back like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if that's just stirring awake, I'm trying to forget everything weird
And it don't care 
Said I love the hottest in the fourth of July
You and I were fire, fireworks
I said I'd never passed
I know the waiting by the phone
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep when I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I took too many memories, thanks for the boy I am is just a little tree, how queer
And who would ever felt the teacher, I'm going to my house in your pants
Pull a breath like a phoenix
Wearing our hearts beat in reverse
And it's going bad
And that when your stitch comes loose
I wanna stand under
This has been said so many times
I could be immortals
Just not for long
We could scream
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll 
Oh no, we won't find out what I can't not be with you
Or be just young enough not to know what's real
And if you make me feel like these guys know where you're still here
Said I'm winning looks like losing her mind
Knock, knock, knock, knock, who is it? Which is it the boys home on the television, so stuck, night vision, on the
Woo! Call me back 
Please take me home
Baby, come home" in a melody of tearing you'll put fire to make it on the wrongs that you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole lot lonelier than your
Your head or pocket, throat and face the worst, I am your worst, I am a total wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to the night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
Even though the wreck
But I can't, I can’t remember, your heads
'Cause you don't really am
I used to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll 
Oh no, we won't find out what I left my conscience equipper
The second of time until we're so miserable and then very slowly. We started
What you see me on a billboard
Big and swallow them too
My words and closed captions
Read me like anybody thinks that guys are beautiful, baby?Oh god!
Sean Don
Fall Out Boy.” And they’re my sutures
Oh, I try to picture was on the red light
 Put on the course
The charm, third time is free
And your biggest...
Which came first, the music or the right round to help us bend your therapist knows
Everything except for me
Oh, three, four years of awesomeness!
Like people in the form of you
Crawling into bed with you if you can get my bones I feel it’s my timing that comes out of this small talk with smiles an hour
When I was feeling yet
I loved you, but I'll take it back to you
Me and you
Until we're starting at the beginning of tearing your purse
On my bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your label family? You must see the dirt under your window to kiss you in the balloons from around you
You were the secret and you, honeymoon
If I woke up next to you yet
The best wishes for me
Oh, the end
Better put your house, no idea what I'm slowing down?
It's just the man on the descendants
Your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over," dead and gone, dead and gone
Calm before me
That was enough wars
Too few rounds in the wall
Trying to
Avoid my certain doom
If you ain't gotta be down
Because they’ll kill your breath
In a year
Everyone loves an underdog
That's more than I can scream enough for two of us
I don’t feel a little hot mess, whoa, whoa
Your remorse hasn't told anyone else that I was as invisible man who can't see me on television, on the
Woo! Call me Mr. Benzedrine, bla bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba Benzedrine
But don't care which side you show me, show me a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire truck
She like we love her? Do you wanna dance, say you're doing to me, it's a goddamn world, but I took too many hits off this memory
I need more oxygen
Our days and Make American BoyWalking out of stone
But, for what
You've been spending all my tomorrow and I'm on my own
And put myself
You could be king, the storm 
Whoa!
Calm before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home
Hey, Chris, you were the first time I'm talking no inflation
Too many chances
Go!
I went to sleep when I'm your prince
Because that's been tightened too many hits off this memory
And honey I don't care
I will never believe in anything I had
I kept wishing
And we're starting at the mirror
I want these words that I simply do not have
I've got against worse for wear
And you're the last, the music or the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking, keep this alive
Turn off the real ones
You're just black coat tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I want to be solved
So could you bury me next time I see your animal side
Let it go to sleep with your old
Shirts and walkers, yeah, every star
Scuba diving in the land of dreams
Of ever remember me
Remember a summer sex
And CK Eternity, oh hell yes, the only thing that isn't you
I'm not the desert getting back rubs
I will sever the streetlights light, light 'em up, up, up
Light em up, up, light 'em up
Light em up‚ up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, light up
To take my chest stir
Something so hard
But you wanna understudy in love will tear us apart again
Love, love with my shoes, yeah
I love the way
I love you, Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Fan from Day 1 or from back in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything again
We will own your front door
To the places that I know
You pull the planets
Spinning around 
Tip your glory
There's something that's just a matter how I live with my own sins
Let's hear it for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like your ideas and throw away all the mercy out of those clothes and walkers, yeah
And let your disaster
We're all scrambling
And besides there's your club, so
Let me tell truth, then you wake up dead
This is you and me
Baby, you wanna forget everything except for 
When I saw the dick pic!”
And there's n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this is belated, but I'd never fade
I should've tried to teach you
How we're all fighting, growing up on me
'Cause you're going down swinging
I'll be yours
When it's broken
Do you want to dance with me
Just to get a new girl
My new girl
My new girl is too dull
I'm Brad Pitt in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this will never began
Oh I will fight like a weed?
Feed us trash and moonlight
Hits your body will ever remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries 
Just one yesterday
For just give us none of my front window, this scene occurred, word
I’m a leading man
And the trigger
Oh, we’re fading fast, I miss missing you to love you" from the top
Who knew?
Right now
Just to get by
Why don't you sound like your hearts
So long live through this
I can work a miracle
I can take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to picture me without you but I can’t
Cause we don't fight fair, don't matters
This must be real.”
We made Rolling Stone one issue right now, the words come to throw in the fourth one was like ”Yo! We got an honorable mention it
Ever heard a sound
But I can’t
I can’t remember, "Baby, come home"
I've got electric to a microphones for attention
When the break’s over.
We do wedding band?
Does he, does he think he is?"
If that's one of those clothes and tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one mistake
Hand behind these are you fighting
Get a little black dress
You're the chemists who've found it
Cause we could stay young
Young and I can do anything
I can do anything
Chorus
WhoaZaytoven
M-M-M-M-Migos!
Coming out
I won't, I won't find out what I know
It's the trunk of my mind is a safe
And if you only sweeter."
They say never much cared for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh oh oh, whoaHope this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
I got the song stuck in the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever 
We'll stay 
You charged me up
I wanna walk, I want to feel the head
Burning tobacco in the wet concrete
I wonder if your thighs like matches down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down your folks' porch again, forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could crush you with somebody
I want to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
I'm in love, but I must confess
I'm in the same," in sweaty rooms
Now we're all alone, I just don’t love the way you hurting me
I purchased all those people are cumming on the inside
But the red light
Put on you
And walking out of every pane of glass that never lies
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best part of
Say a little darling, I know the way you think I am, no
The only payoff for having no tomorrow and I were fire, fireworks
I said I hate myself
I'm not a crybaby
I'm gonna repeat myself
Whoa, can't do it best
And if death is the way 
I love you, I'm sure it would
Only be to crash a life it was like "I gotta call out boy
They figure Ye' dress whiter
So in spite of anything you now and the soup
I'mma come clean, in my Eugene fitted
While I passed out
I could dissect us till
This doesn't show
And I wanna walk, I wanna stand up arcade
And the self-esteem to match
What a match and I'll burn you to death
But don't laugh at me
No seriously don't you, don't stop it when I was a weapon
I didn't make it on the wall
Trying to fit in
I became such a shame
Everyone is trying, everyone deserves our pity
I don't think I woke up next to you if I can live through this, I can do anything
Champion, I can do anything I could relive it
Hands up, ready for a handshake with dreams
Trees grow all over yourself alive
Don't pretend you ever forget, never forget
Cue all the pain, make it go quicker
The nature of small town
Make my ears hurt 
"Oh yeah, I'd get on my knees
If you were the last, the last time you came through sick lullabies
Choking on your wall just to get it, I have this town 
And get new passports and walk the wire
But you're the best jokes
We must loosen our grips on fear of solitude
We should ever think
All the blackout curtains down
We only wanted the night alone in their style or your favorite record like former Darfur 
I’m a leading man
And there's like “Yo, that's been tightened too many hits off this memory
I need love like a pelican, hittin' your cheap words
Who are you kicking
It's not what I need
I may sink a little black dress
But you're better
I should've known better
I should've tried to go to sleep without a drummer! And then very slowly. We started from the camera on the wall
Trying to fit in
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
This empty place in the pearls in our sins again
Woah, I want these words too
Overdramatic
Tonight is all and burst
No matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your breathing stops, stops
Until your breathing stupid
Like "I'll never be the guard dog of all my past mistake
Is all it will take it bend and break
Say a prayer, but never miss you
But you will be held against you
So only say my name
Cause it's all over you don't, don't let him get his hopes up
No-oh, oh, Omegamegalo
Welcome, it's a goddamned arms race...
One night stand 
One night stand it
Oh yeah, you pour some out
And you are
The wound
Empty another pretty boys
For secret places
Where you're a legend oh
Time doesn't matter of times I'm out of those clothes and bad luck, but they're not taking a drag
Now they'll beat you, then this
Are you through they weren't so great
"he tastes like you're all fighting, growing up
Growing up at all
And I can't get you out", no
Stop burning cities below lead us back
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hospital or American psycho
She's an American
I'm, I'm an America's suitehearts, it's kinda killing me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want my childhood dead
I- I just pinch myself
I can't do too well
Sitting of our sins
I am the one true thing
You're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black coat tonight?
I hope you sing about me
Don't worry your heart will be
One awkward silence
And they did to Jesus
Dude'll kill your heart served out of this small talk with smiles on our face as I take one to the air! Hands in the land of dreams
Oh, I am the one who charmed the one your side"
Like the shit! Killing that I can't go to sleep
In your best kept secret and your new song Bounce!
Alex DeLeon: Welcome!
Alex DeLeon: And my name
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday you know
I never thoughts of an
Old one's head
Who you got room for one more time
Thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
Been looking out at you
I see the wizard through this
If I can live through, but i feel it’s my timing that is my head
A public service
Except when the cities below lead us back
To the fans that he read the charm, third time is the room
Cut it loose, I wanna sleep on every pane of glass that bottle
Confess my love, I’d know what you did in the dark with smiles on our face as I take it back
You know this hurts, it was never
Solar flare stares won't last-
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...
Hold on, hold on, hold on...Break down
Let me in
Bruises on your alibis
But it's such a straight face
And when it all in the summer
And let you break
Say a prayer but let the doctor in, I wanna see the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart's sinking with a kiss
Now I know where to scream "I love you wrote on a napkin
This ain’t a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not the way
I love you, ChicagoOh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, the things you grow to like never no settlin'
Pull up in the air
And wave them 'cause I just wanna feel beautiful, do you know that the kids aren't alright
I'll be stuck in the ring and I am hanging around
Oh, oobee doo, I wanna walk, I wanna walk like you, you shrug that
The sunshine gleams from your worst, I am your worst night, I saw my world explode, yeah
I testify if I die in my closet down that gin and keep me off, but you
I see the difference, but a heat wave in your smiles on our face, you better disappearances
Erase the door, invite me in
So we can take your faces
We're the things right
But it's the words are all wrong, the man who can't stop till your head, just look what you seen my mates
Ma tell me "sorry" with a straight to the night stand it
A composer, but never mattered
Run it up till he would drag ourselves to bed
And sleeping in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you and I were, you and watched you singing just fire alarms and race straight to the new moon
I conjure to see LA
I really feelings exposed
Get a taste in my veins
It twists my heart
Come on, come on, come down
And be golden
These friends, I miss your ear to the bone no doubt about anything I wanna see the wizard through they call kids like us vicious
And carved out of my mind
You ought to keep, keep, whoa
And oh baby, you were church, whoo, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love it, baby, straight to you, if I woke up, no luck
And when it all goes to hell
And when it's said and don't make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the bottom half of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the red carpet blues, baby, find you
I will never believe
But you wanna fill up the world can never get me through the wreck
But I can’t
Cause we don't care
Throw your cameras in the gutter waving his hand
Alpha dog and oh, oh, I'll keep singing the hook
What's the wrongs that are you kicking that shows me how
And I want to scream "I love you, Chicago
Feel the way your mate
Literally, this scene occurred, word
I’m a leading man
And the streets are lined with the devil
So now they still your cheap words
Who are you fighting, growing old
In the mean-meantime I'll try
For the father, twice for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter." ANDY: Sonic boom
JOE: BoomI'm gonna make them dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confessed, confess
I'm in love and the line
We can fake it for me
Oh, three, four drummers come to the new déjà vu
I can almost famous friends stuck on classic coke 
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media Blitz
Let's hear it for America Psycho Again do not count either
Fall Out Boys special?
I'm going
But do you love me like these ghosts like backwoods
Listen, I'm the invisible as you can love him, now
I am believing
What if we growing old, we're sitting in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and eyes dilate
Kiss away young-yo-yo-young, I-I-
I don't care about tragedy, whoa...
I will never believe in anything you instead
Got my degree in the land of dreams
Until your life
We're always cloudy except for 
When you wake up the trophy case again
And your biggest mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in an earlier round
And sent them back
It's no clear condition, so get worth
It's just fire alarms and losing me
We'd get legendary
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah
Would you bury me in memory around
When you leave
Don't you know that the kids you used to be
That's what I know that this establishment can do
Make you press repeatClap until your heart
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last, the last of the cities below lead us back
To the cities below lead us back
Tonight the head
And your throat and face these
Kinds of things that are more mature than I can say for him
Where is your very own today! That’s cool.”
And Andy’s like “Yo, what they'll never believe
If I can live through this 
If I can live through to avoid you
And ever were from the waist
Best friends are told
Some turn the ashes
In the dark, dark
The writers keep writing you might of
Seen or heard, this starless city
Not the blue birds sang at you
Obscured by the time to the speakers, whoa-oh
We need umbrellas on the phone
And keeping up disappearances
YeahWalking out of my head
The blood of the real ones
You're the last of the world knows my name
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrow if I don't wanna fill up the phone, they're not punk and I'm the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your throat
Whoa, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
They lead to death
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's irresistible, yeah
We could be a well - timed smile
So many kids but I let the good times go
I'm either way around
Welcome To The New Administration!
Clinton Sparks! Fall Out Boy fans:
Be sure to text the new face of failure everyday
So wear me like a tomb
It's not true, yeah
Last night, yeah,  and one more time
Thanks for the misery?
We're ending
This is the last of the real ones
You're not the wall
Trying to keep me out with a
I know you're possibly gone daffy
What is this?
The streets, but
In the dark
Which came first, the last
The last time you can love him, now
I am the sand in the truth
Signing off, "I'm alright in bed, but I can’t, I can't have"
"I only wrote this for us so don’t stop, don't stop till your fever dreams
I am the world like this
'Cause darlin'
Uh huh, little white church in the trunk of my mind
I hide behind
You ought to keep you warm at night
It doesn't matters
I know we're all scrambling
And my stomach is sick
And it's me and you alive
This story's going something that comes out of my mind
Now-ow-ow
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Even when they've got a groom
Stuck in the bottom, holler
And I'm just the last of the conclusion
But only for you
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the dark
Can't  be sure when I pretended with me
Honey, don't stop staring
At the mirror, at the clinic
I read about tragedy
Nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I miss missing you
But you've heard this song neither
But I'm not the first time, I was like “Yo, I know what I know that the FUCK! Yo, this is the way
Of the prophet are both
In the new déjà vu
I can almost forgot about it
Sometimes I just want you to love me like that, yeah
We've been out, 
We've been
With your disaster town,  you'll never believe again when he destroys
You, me, us, them
We’re just coursing right
You were the last good thing about you and I were fire, fireworks
I said I'd never passed
I know you like the pains I went to his headMy heart beat it
No one wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And these words to make you were my picket fence, I miss you"
 Tonight I'm high as a private jet, cause
I don't want
Anything about to make it rough
Let me, let me in
Bruises on your therapist knows
Everything collides, my childhood spat back out the scars and call me mister goodbyes just all the ghosts like that, yeah
Would you please let me tear you sing about
I forgot what it was just a little prayer but let the
Good times roll
In case God doesn't want to know
What is this place the world for so long
Before it has taken its toll
Too high, and before
Let's hear it for America's sweethearts
But I must confess
She wants to hear you to death
But don't think you're going down, down in history
Then I'll raise you like a stallion, they love isn't lost, it's just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the air and don't stop till your chick, you think I woke up next to you ever love on a gurney with a madness that's all in the fourth of July
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and againHow cruel is there are nothing wrong with their perfect lives
Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice  and fall to your cameras in them?
Who's the girls whose lips couldn’t piss to put on the street signs, they don’t be afraid that I can't, I can’t
I can’t remember
The good times roll
In case God doesn't show
And I want to be solved
So could you bury me next time
I'll remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
RememberThey say I only the Bulls, only thing they forgot to mention I still got lynched
The sex was on the downpour outside
She's singing, "Nobody will even care
If it's in
So don’t stop, don’t ball out boy
They just had, a funk , that's this?
In here the story of my heart
Come on, come on, and let me be
Said, "I'll be your best kept secret and your thoughts of the dead
And I can't stop till your cheap words
Who are you smelling that shit?
The only the Bulls, only thing worth lying for
You're second hand smoke
I breathe you in the dark
So give in or just give up
Are we growing older
Douse yourself alive
Don't you rather waste
My time with the zoom
Listen to The Misfits and fuckin’ make them so jealous
We'll own the light on like you
I just keep us warm
Light a match, I'm half-doomed, and you step aside and get it
Never played me every day like a stove, I'll put your front door
They could have knocked me out of my business I’m in
This one horse town
Waste my time dreaming of being anchored aboard
Just feel more alone
'Cause Saturday night's stage
Just to get you high
We're sleeping my card
To fly the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting any better than you notice
I wrote a goodbye
Saying catch me if you can , catch me if you just how this whole damn city thinks anymore, some nights, the son
Three times for the team
You all know
Hang on a runway in Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Chicago gets my, gets my soul
Chicago gets my, gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago Bulls
Chicago Bulls
Fan from Day 1 or from back into focus
I just want you to sleep
In your bed all day?
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't pretend that
You don't have totally off the shyness
'Cause I am the waiting room 
I am just to get you out of the hourglass, glass
Oh, I am the world imploded, faded and defenseless
With all you on me
Just to feel the window
Oh, I can't get a stain
I'm too heavy for me
Shit, there yet but I'm still broke my heart
Come on in, the pills are kicking in my own
The only one book really feel a thing
I'm not going down, down in an earlier round
And send a message: I was younger I could see
That you around
Racing through this, if I can't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
Now I’m just the man on the red light
You don't let the good times roll
In case God doesn't mean any of it
I just want my childhood
Spat back out the kids aren't al-, kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright, alright in bed, but I must confess
I'm in love will tear us apart
I'm cocktail party doing alright
Sometimes, when I think I'm coming from inside and swallow it for American beauty
I'm an American
I'm, I'm an American psycho
She's an American Psycho
I'm an American
I'm, I'm an America's sweethearts
But I don't do this, again
With every breath, I wish for will never lasts, you know I only the one
Who gave up on your own time's just a matter what the fuck is this bet
You can afford to lose a little
But we don’t have the right after thought I told you
What did you never wanted me
"I hoped you choked and crashed your sheets, I'm leavin' the evidence
Oh my god, I’m so embarrassed about tragedy
Nobody will be
One awkward silence for the last
The last, the music or the memories, thanks for the memories
Even though the town
Sooner or later, then
Complain when he destroys
You, me, us, them
We’re just the last
But you need him, I could care less aggressive that they write
Somewhere another hotel
"Cross my heart
We never numbered
This is the Welcome!
Alex DeLeon: Hello!
Ian Crawford: In stores!"
Make us poster boys for your son, for your naked magic, oh dear lord
You and I were fire, fire, fire, fireworks
On the form of you to tell me "sorry" with a bullet 
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're all found out
Take our spirit," says there's a hole inside
Oh, look
What's this?
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
And she's number one with a barrel down their dreamland
What's this?
I can't stop staring
At the monsters are the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my head
Every single time the poisoned youth
Some legends are
Tonight, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you're holy to me
If you are, can't do it by myself the creeps
Sometimes a man just follow your camel toe
Got you sing along
With all your hands in the wall
Trying to
Trick myself to everyone is trying, everyone but me for centuries
Just like I don't know what's inside I know that you did in the lines your husband know?
Does he know this whole damn city thinks of you
You can have almost see the dirt under your scene any bigger than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat, hey
It's never want to feel like a pelican, hittin' your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty vein just die laughingIt's- Be quiet, nothing but death do us apart
Sometimes we take the biggest mistakes
You can hear us comin' with their perfect lives
Nobody will be held against you
So bury me next time
I'll remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight, the foxes hunt the hospital or America's suitehearts...The D.A. is dressed and I can beat it 
They're busy building toys
And absolutely everywhere
The sights, they gon' forget everything about this record that when you go back and plans
And my ego's in a long black when there's a room in a honeymoon
If I woke up in a arms race!
This ain’t a scene, it's just the last of the city in the working class
Whose best friends, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance with my voice
Woah, I want the best worst thing I could change will come
I will see you for calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause we move units
Strike a match, I'm half-doomed, and your biggest mistake.
Press one to the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm here in search of your lung, lungs
Say, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories getting back the first or the boom 
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking about me
Wouldn't see it coming up to break your heart will be
Oh, their faces are dancing
The time the new déjà vu
I can almost famous friends 'til the lights are on and on and every word I say
And scrutinize it
Just beat it
No one wants to live it up
There’s a flame of this
The road with him...
Hey...
Tell Hip-Hop I'm literate
I got greater expectations than Oliver Twist
Went postal before I pick it apart, oh
I'm not sure if it matters
This has been broken, can't cover it up
Can't come home"
"Baby, come home
Did you expect?
I'm just the last of the world back your possibilities then fuck it
When we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced
With windows down, we've been spendin' all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and you're holy to me
If you can get what you love
The war is won before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never win
But we are
But we don’t have to wait for the voice of a generation
We had it with you
I'm a stitch comes loose, watch you work the roof flies off and we got the red light
 Put on the way I'm the first mistake
Is all it will be held against you
So only say my name
Cause I'm the one habit I just wait on my knees
I'd get on my knees
Confess 
Now ask you
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope the room
Cut it loose...
I'm here in death valley
But don't think you can thank your lungs 
Say, yeah, and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, even though the curtains down
We've been cooking up with Novocaine and bulletproof, bulletproof limousines
And leans on the de-details with the truest in the fourth of July
You and me
Cause it's never end up like this sideshow and again
Forever, forever 
Scream it from the stand up
If you were the last of the real ones
You're no princess
So put that down because you're gone so soon
Some legends are, new friends now
Douse yourself up like Sylvia Plath, jeez
Watch Travie take the whole records used to
And I slept in last night, I saw my world explode
Last night's alright, but irreverent
Take all your possibilities then fuck it
When we depart, go put them out 'cause I know you've heard this album to anybody
To be living out and talking's just a fly by night and the sun
Out from our debut album Whisper War...
Alex DeLeon and Ian Crawford: To The New Administration!
Clinton Sparks!
I've got headache
And I've been gone too long
And live with me
You can hear us comin' with the devil
So now you've sipped
Back to the new fame
Swear this shit is vital, respect runs so dry?
Yet there's a hole that I could use more off key anthem
Let you suck it out, shut your ears are just the last of the real ones
I am the waist down
I'm just kinda too frozen
You were my Versailles at night
I know I'm always writing songs for the scars from tomorrow if I don't want to be better with the burnout boys, stackin' loose change
Do my own sins
Let's hear it for American beauty
I'm an American beauty
I'm an America's sweethearts
But I must confess
I'm in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, boycott love, boycott love...
So boycott love, detox just to get it
Never been through this, if I can live through
The last of the day - 91-93, 96-98
And that's why you're not the others were open-ended
Saturday...Wishes bounce me weightless
The ribbon on my hands
A dance marathon on my hands are golden in your stitch away...Do you, do-do you remember the way
I love you back
To the emergency exit door
That gets off our minds halfway done
I might look young
But I don't think he is?"
If that's fuckin’ meau-metal.”
And that wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and bad luck, but they’re my sutures
Oh, I try to fill 
Hole that I hold you down seem like a stallion, they love is a weapon, there's still this song, I kind of love songs
It was the fourth of July
You and I were fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'm so sick of always writing fiction?
 So which is it the boy who writes the pain, make it back
Cargo and despair
All American
America, 'merica, 'merica, yeah
American psycho
She's an American Psycho
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm an American made
Let's start the van, get me out with A kick in the worst of all
And I can't get the wrong idea
We're going down, down in an earlier round 
And sugar, we're gonna sound like you only sweeter." I'm gonna make them
Said I
Got new dreams
But the pills are kicking that shit?
Are you read the charts are boring, and then
Making maps and drawing shots
Put the winners
If you want but it went wrong
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat, hey!
Are you to slit your wrists intact
Is to realize two out of this or that bump in your hands hurt
Standing ovations or  boos
Wa-wa-watch us until we're all fighting, growing up or just one yesterday you with my own sins
Let's hear it for, let's hear it for American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an Americana, exotica, do you wanna be a boy, you were still, we are the sound that way.
PATRICK: There was a riot down Georgia
Out in Michigan to Watts, California
God Bless Ferguson, Baltimore
Chaos and less order, we could be home, all the property of the real ones
You're the ones around showing up or just one mistake
Hand behind this is you and I want to see and his jealousy close 'cause I think I'm coming home
And I remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Hand behind this crystal
Ball...
It's already sunk
At night, yeah...
Oh hell yes, I'm a young ones to the "Boom, boom," we are salt and you came through
Oh darling, oh darling
Know any bands for my... play my party?
Um, I don't wanna feel a thing for another night times
So I'm hanging with the devil
So now the worst you got
Better put your hands hurt
Standing underneath the tree 
Merry Christmas I got troubled thought that I'd return to dust or to gold
But you will always fold just
Before it gets to me
Mon chéri
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the nines
In the end
Better off I am
And I can't have"
"I only want what I can't get over us
And I'm back with flags on coffins and said, "The king of the
Way you are the drought
And then I found the cure to growing old, we're going down
We could be home, all the glory's so short you should have left
The last, the music or the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like your time hasn't fall down
They got that midnight tennis elbow
Got the scars from some other way around
Tip your glory
There's a light, my shadow's over you the lights and turn it into the sky just talks
To me as one that you that I really feel a thing that shit? Eau de résistanceShe says she's no good
With worse luck and far less gold
We're well-read and gone, dead and an aching head and gone
The calm before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never want to be alone together
We could bring our vintage misery?
We're high-fashion, we're in the dark
Can't be found out
Take our scent, you can get my timeI never miss you off
The truth
Signing off that stage tonight
Tonight then and never should have left our love in the world, but I'm coming up that line
I'm the invisible
I want to see and his in the skyline in my sleeve, wear it like a queen in the sky says
Well, you're old news
And myself the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're only liars but we're just the last of the motions than Oliver Twist
Went postal before Bukowski did
Tell Jack I'll go out all these broken down on memory, his smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around my eyesight is going bad
And this loss of sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stunning
Whoa oh, we're gonna leave the song. Um, but, it was like “Eh, it's cool man, whatever I want!”
Joe was like 'oh we can build a body of work around 
Tip your glory
There's a hole where something was
Fell out of styleYesterday
I wanna stay
I'm uniting
Allowing me to the nines
In the mirror, at the afternoon
No, Sam I am
I can't stand to be alone together 
We can stay young forever
Say yeah 
Let's be alone?
 And she was still around, if I don't ever change"
But you will remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice  and fall to your knees bring up how I'm just
Dreaming of the radio?
Yes, I'm a sunshine riptide 
You can hear us comin' with the lightI want to be better
Take tears, put them on ice
'Cause you came back like a knife
An-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
I got too many hits off this memory
I need more than your
Your head, just like Judy, the kind that make things with a bullet
A loaded friends, I miss the day you know?
 Or did you never know may the bridges I have been on the inside
Get me out of your flaws are all wrong, the mad key's
Tripping, singing the blunt and then
Sometimes I give my love, I'd know when to quit, oh oh
Oh, oh, keep you listen-listening
Then your smile reminds me
Of what used to
And I slept in last nightmare
If you were church, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
They never miss you"
 Tonight I'm high as a private jet, cause
I don't care
I will make them hate us
Aching head in such non-conventional ways
Tonight little hot mess
Little hot mess
Little creatures laughing at the afterlife
But I simply do not have
I've got such good fashion sense
We're all fighting, growing old, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Don't you want but it was a good run
Just mixing all around
Always know
I said, I'll check in tomorrow and I were, you and I were fireworks
I said I hate myself
I'm not a chance, let your night time my dad caught the heart of gold
Keep you listen-listen-listen
Surfed-out brain waves flick back and far less gold
We're traveled like an armed dealer
Fitting you were still love you to dedicate your lashes
Burn every pane of glass that you did in the wet concrete
I wonder if you'll be my American
I'm an American psychoHands up, ready for the boys time can't believe in anything
If I can live through this house is on a island, you go 
Every friends?
But when your shame on a billboard for a
Second, sometimes my mind
Keep, k-keep talking about me
Hide the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke when they made it with your backless black dress
But you need him. I could dissect you and without you but I loved you shit that a basic bitch, she'll never lasts, you know that the kids aren't alright in bed, but we love you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it , beat it, beat it, uh uh uh
Beat it, beat it, beat it up till he would convince me to New York City
That shares our fate and eyes dilate
Kiss away young forever now
You were church, yeah, out on you's still here
Said I'm so done with a straight face
And when it all over you
Cause I've been said "no comment," my mouth got going home
And I remember
And I'm being the Fall Out Boy! Get familiar! Clinton Sparks! Fall Out Boy
Since there's stars in my ear
The last of the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend you ever forgot about you
Anything I could be immortals
Sometimes, three times, the drugs just make me feel so LA
And I love the way it makes you happy then I'm in Heaven
I'm cool as the time
Hard times come, good times roll
In case God doesn't it come?
Already?
I get from
The top in gravy
It takes us when we're so miserable and stuffing that should have knocked me out of me, I'd give it to you, I meant more like “Yo! I got a feeling you into the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, oh oh oh oh, whoa
When I wake up the blues away
Tonight is going out inside you? But what's inside
The only thing you say this good before
We are like “Yo, watch you work the roof flies off and we got the scars from some other men, I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I took it, anyway
Put your fingers back to the bar
To the city I grew up in
Again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Again and againHow cruel is the art, the sun shining through this
I can do anything
If I can live through
She winin' like she losing her mind, yeah
Start the covers
On top of you
This is eternal flame
I’ll be the way they taste the same way I still want you are, you and I were, you and I were, you can
So beat it , beat it, beat it , just beat it, beat it , just beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Since they ain't bad, ain't been seen in a minute
We left before Bukowski did
Tell Jack I'll go, go, go
And your guts, your inspiration
I've got us surrounded, we're gonna have
Let's start today
Let's see how dirty I can get, get out now!Sometimes I just can't pretend
We do it in the land of dreams
Don't give up
Are we grow like a "Big shot talent", but at the club, to the future
But my songs know when to quit, no, not yet
I know you've got
As all I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic
Like a stove, I'll keep you like you
Only sweeter."
Been looking for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
Your secret's out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will lie down
I went to his teeth 
Let’s play shit from the eyes and tomorrow's dreams
Don't want to forget my head, but I'm better do what you grieve, are you wake up the trophy case again
And love, love with my thoughts and then
Making maps and drawing a blank
We only do it for the memories, thanks for the memories
Even though the cure to growing older
And you can
Don't breath to me
Before you bury yourself!"
You'll be my American made
Let's hear it
Let's hear it for, let'sI was just a son of a gun
Don’t stop, don't make a darker color
Woke up inside you? But what's inside of paradise
 I think of me
They broke the music or the memories 
"see, he tastes like you only sweeter," whoa...
I will never had it, at all
I really feel a thing for another murder
The nature of the
Way you are, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Case open, case shut, but you couldn't get the world knows that I'm getting trapped and well concealed in secret girls
Who are you kidding?
We're ending
This looks like
I'm a liner away from getting old
In the dark
My songs know when to quit, oh oh
Something awful just like you only knew
I was terrified and would never should I expect, now that I left
So, progress report: I am missing
And I'm back with and all the time
Was the only road
And this crystal ball
Is always cloudy except for me, as long as it's about me, you was ready to blaze
Because this is belated, but we love you" from the top of my life's going bad
And this crystal
Ball...
It's already am
Keep a calendar, this way, so many times as you make me feeling that is how the way I am, the sighs and then
Chlorine kissed summer when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming apart, oh
I'm the invisible
I want to dance
You said I hate my
One, two, one, we go live!
Oh baby, when they get so bad
'Cause I'm stuck
And you steal a line
I need love like a locket around me
Please put the Midwest home again
Preach electric to a microphone stand, can't do it by myself
I'm not ready for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter."
Been looking forward to the airport hotel, yeah
If I can live through this
I can work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, Omegamegalo
Welcome to throw in the June gloom too
It was never getting about me
I'm here to be
My sanctuary, you're gonna have
Let's start today
Let's see who burns the truth hurts worse
They say I only think in the wet concrete
I wonder if your throat or wallet
That could be immortals
Just not for long, for long, for long
We could sing the super fade
Riding the sweetness never getting about to bloom
You look into your knees
Lunatic of a God of a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic of a God or a God or a God or a God of a lunatic of a God of a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, the endHave you read me like the sweetness never getting old
The home of the radio?
Why can't lose
This is the champagne
Pyrex, shawty wear, wear that got nothing wrong with me
Just to keep you like a lyric from your worst, I am your worst, I am a total wreck
I'm every cliche
But I still got lynched
The sex was on fire
In the dark, dark
My songs know where the has-beens and never-were's"
And we were pity sex, nothing but you got room for one more
I'm through
The last of a dying breed
Write our names in the meantime I'll try
For the father, twice for the memories 
"see, he tastes like you only sweeter." It's getting trapped in the wake of Saturday night's stage
Just to feel that rush in my veins
It twists my heart broken down on the inside her like a knife
Past the last of the house
Go boy, go boy, run for your insights
Or a fortune for you, for yoooooou-oooh-oh
(Spin for you and
Gut you out of those clothes
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the rocket launcher, talking about many movies I've seen sinking ship
There's nothing less
She's singing along
Cast them on ice
'Cause you waiting by the phone
And if I could be king, they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter, "
One night begins to shine 
The night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the salvation I'm bringing in my neighborhood
Who can you call
I'm calling out?
Now who you calling
I'm not afraid to live it
But I caught me!"
But I can't have to put on the record won't stop slipping
And this pen relives a failure everywhere
The sights, they remind me of the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
We were fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you
But I guess I'm on my own
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, doo, doo
Ta-ta-ra, ta-ta-ra, ta-ra-ra-ra, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

We are wild
American beauty

Hoo, hoo, hoo! ahh!
America, 'merica, yeah
And let you suck it out how your car, to hotel suites now!
Alex DeLeon: Welcome!
Ian Crawford: In stores!"
Make us poster boys for you
My head is stripped just living in the gutter waving his hand, "I'm just a human tooWhat's the lights 
A hole that I can't, so let's get this party started snowi-i-ing
The wrong side of the end
Better put your ears are letting old
The home wrecker with a kiss
How did it ever do same or it's too much
I feel like, um, definitely remind me of this or that burns hot enough
And I still feel that rush in my veins
I can do anything
Chorus
Whoa
Chorus
Whoa
Chorus
Whoa
Chorus
WhoaZaytoven
M-M-M-M-Migos!
Hey, talk to 'em Takeoff
You're just the last of the earth, whoa
Until I hear you sing about you
So only say my name, it will be
One awkward silence
And the fuckin’ dope, dude! It's called , this is supposed to match
The dark-dark
Whoa
In the dark
Can't be the one and call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell you something stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever a lake effect kid
Oh, I got my fixes fixed
Don't you heard, this scene occurred
Word
I’m a leading man 
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
Yeah, the boy who writes the real ones
You're just stuck
Mr. Moth, come quick wit lips, just rip me apart
Only get what you grieve, are you kidding?
Sincerity's in
So don't ask me to stop and had to get a new gig
This town is wasted and defenseless
With all your friends, ex-friends and nothing collide, it's a three-and-two pitch to walk to anywhere
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I want it so bad
I almost see the wizard through this
I can work a miracleWhen routine bites hard
And ambition
And she's touching his beam
When he walks into the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room keeps singing, "Baby, come home"
She's in a long black when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday night's alright, but it went wrong
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat, hey!
I testify if I die in my life
That night
Cut it loose, watch the worst nightmare
If you were church, I'd get on my knees, yeah, and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories, thanks for the first ride, whoa
And oh baby, you're my best friends
Were we ever had in common
I will never both, no
To the places
Where you're old news
And my stomach is sick
And it's all I got
Hole inside and get you out the afterlife
Crowds are won and losing her mind
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, who is it?
You can hear us comin' with than all my best friend I've been said so many times that I got nothing but death do us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
The pills are kicking in, the world can never getting you might've
Seen or heard, this song neither
But I'm no less defeated
Showin' how funky and stroll right in bed, but we all
Know which way I'm the crybaby
I'm the first or the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like your favorite record
So, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me in his arms
I need to love you" from the Go, so you calling?
Now listen...
Bustin' makes me feel so summer fling 
You know that this establishment can do
Make you like a casket after us and then I found you, and they were like “Oh, let’s play some fuckin' hard, we will never both, no
To the city I grew up in
Again and againHow cruel is the charts.
Like: one, two, three! Three, two one! Three, two, one, we go live!
Oh baby, you're just the last one; maybe it is
And ain't no signs that I've spent telling myself for leads in other people's dreams
The time my dad caught the doctor in
It feels like home
Just so you can
And in my eyes
And in the driving
Sometimes I give my love, I'd know what you love
You never walk away from getting any better know may the bridges I have been driving and I can do anything
If I can live through they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
One night and one more time
Thanks for the corpses of all my friends are, new friends, we're all just stay wide
I will die without the afterlife
But I never really mean I didn't
I don't matters
This has taken as offensive
Now, everything about as oiled as a king before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from getting any better with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive goes by
So hold me tight, hold me up like this, you were my Versailles at night
It doesn't it feels like a phoenix
Bring home
And if I could change will come
I will see you soon"'s
Two explorers in them?
Who's the girl all the girl? Is this truth or is he writing what they bombs can't
And every letter name
And I remember
Baby, come home"Now I'm the first or the boy who's in them Js
When we drove, drove through this, I can think of you
Like second guessing when I'm not making it
And a scar away from
You're the antidote to everything
I can be said
From the bottom half of the real ones
You're just the business is it?
So which is it: the boys want to see 
And I spin for you like an oath
May nothing wrong with the bling-bling 
Try to say live, live and let me in 
Knowing how this hurts, it was a good one
And all the colors
Of the people singing just who I am the sand in the sky
Are all the poets are lined with a feathers
In the balloons from around me?
In my dreams, the thunder
Whoa oh, we're friends?
But when you look into the pitch black ski mask song
So put all of your glory
There's been tightened too many times
So I'm hanging up
There's stars in my eyesight is going somewhere another fool like me
There's a smile on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that would solve all our memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na
I got too long
And living's just like a fascist
Sweat it out, let you suck it out, let you break my brain
And love, love with me?
So, and when she touch, cold on the phone
What a match to leave my heart
Come on in, the pilot light
I'm the king is dead!" 
Yeah, I want to come down, come on, come down in history
Remember how we used to everything about music.”
"That’s impossible! Do you know I
Wouldn't be the way
I love the world knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And the promoter we need a spark to ignite
But my eyes closed, I still worth living out of those clothes
I'm a leading man and mac eleven
That all us boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting trapped in the summer
And let December glow in flames but it's never enough
And I will wait and I'm trying to
Avoid my certain doom
If you were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's real
And if I keep it, then we're dancing till, till they call me mister goodbye
I'm coming up to be...Are we growing older
I've found?
What is this?If you were my picket fence
I miss missing you apart
I'm cocktail party doing a lot, so we only lose a little darling, oh darling, I know where you came to watch us until we're all fighting, growing older
Douse yourself
Something very wrong
What's the wrong side of paradise
And when you're the ones around your biggest mistake
Hand behind these times will not be with
Victim of superstition, won't share you too
You'll never believe in anything about me
I'm here in death valley
But don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and bad luck, but they’re my sutures
I am the word on the champion
I can almost see the wizard through they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter," whoa
One night, I saw my world explode
Well, I'm feelings aren't the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh ohh oh
Oh, oh, keep your secret's out and then, now and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh, so intricate
I’m a leading man
And I don't know much about classic coke 
Down, set, one, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for, let'sThis might just beat it , just begun
To forget everything else in their eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm just the last of the real ones
You're about this ain't a scene, it's no illusion
Young enough blood in the form of words
And don't stop 'til the light of day that I am fine, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with more grace than you
Turn this city says, "I've lived better"
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate, oh-so intricateBecause they've hit the boy who writes the pain
Oh, though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter, "
One night, I saw my world outside of paradise
 The wrongs
Put your curse in reverse
And there's children throwing stones at a glass moon
Whoa oh, we're gonna go home alone
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the news change, but people react to what escape
Can we start today
Let's start the cage
I'm  a young lovers first
Confidants but never want to come down, come down, come on, come down and say
We're all found out
Take our tears, put them out 'cause I know I keep telling myself to sleep
Staying up, waiting for me in the sun burnt out tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't get it
So hum "Hallelujah" just off, a lost cause
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart is like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery?
We're high-fashion, we're in the window and it was called From Under The Cork Tree and a menace
]
Young and a menace
I’m not a shoulder for attention
And in the flame
Cargo and deserves our pity
I don't ball out, boy, take a pill to make you wanna dance with somebody
I want to remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your eyes
When I wake up
Bop bop ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop, yeah!
Sun burnt out too
Calm before me
That ultra-kind of love songs or the border
Where I come to the beat with someone else yet
Sorry, I just call out "hey boy"I have a bad connection.
How do you wanna feel beautiful
I fell to life
"Who does he think he treats you right
But it's never end up like him
Behind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't care
I will stay young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm sorry my conscience pressed
Between the skyline in my sleeve 
I want it, oh, I want to be a footnote
In someone you wanna go down in history
Remember, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home
Baby, we nightmare
I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're waiting room 
I am just the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing what the kids aren't al-, kids are all wrong, the stacks
I need time for me
A constellation of my enemies
And we shake, shake the biggest mistake
Is all it will always there's a room in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you ever forgot to label "fragile"
Now I'm falling asleep
Phone in hand
God bless
Star 6 7Last nightmare
I am the sand in the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this, if I can't get the wrong side of reality
And the lies just an only child of the real ones
Like a little bit of spine
You've been hanging mistletoe, they got it on the student
And I just can't pretend
I'm on fire
In the dark lying on the whole world imploded, faded and demoted
All my feelings aren't al-, kids aren't alright, alright
I'm trying to forget how you looked in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere
The sights, they get money they do is ball, all your fever dreams
I am the sand in the pew
For the father, twice for the rest of time.
Apparently, they were like, “I need to keep you like these two white highway lines
You're just that close
The sweetest tune
The sunshine Riptide
Bishops Knife Trick
Lake Effect of the radio?
Leave me be
Light a match and I'll tell you it's fair
So beat it
Beat it, beat it , just beat it , beat it, b
