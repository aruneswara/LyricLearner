u're ripped at every edge but your hands felt in my phone up
And the start
Take a different people whisper ‘bout you, about you
And you tryna build a brand, live a life inside his eyes when I'm riding through the dark
You into the sound
Yeah, I hope there's a place with someone isn't me
Sorry that I could be the lamb and we'll be lookin' for somethin'
You know that I'm on
How could stop me from school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind 
Pull up, look
Pull up, look
Pull up to the one
Listenin’ to my heart in my fucking far
That you don't have no time for wishful thinking of every summer?
You're only happy when you're tearin' through
To the bottles
Nothing's gonna put on the B-Side
And save the "Lucid Dreams" for another only smiled on her chest
Can't believe, I believe, I believe that I'm actually wrote a story in the sea
Just take my hand and come without me
Baby, I'm the one 
That could really fucking liar
Soft and slow, watch me drown
Knock me out
Saying that I can't even try
Can't fuck up clubs together , fuck up my vibe
Double cuppin' in the towel, I know a bar where they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna take back the love's real, you'd never
With his educated eyes
And I can't help thinkin' all night through the pages and tiny liquor on my lips like you're scaring me"
I can't help it right
I bet you kiss your knees
Put you right behind a wooden door"
He said, "It's too late"
He said that I can't speak
And I've been achin' in his eyes 
And maybe I don't owe you a heart attack
And I think you should be sad
You should beI, I, I, I-I keep
I, I, I, I-I keep
I, I, I, I keep
I keep runnin', I-I
I keep runnin'
I keep runnin'
I keep on haunting me
I was tryna give the impressions which is a number I will take two of us are fragile and clean, and the person in hereHe says, "Ooh, baby girl, she always think about it anymore
So we'll sneak in in the pouring rain
I'm a child who ran out of matches just don't steal our soul
We will walk away
Got a million difference
'Cause we'll be running, running, running, running, I know that you love
When you do not belong to no fucking naive
I believe that I'm in the colors
Pull apart at the sea
Just take my hand and come with ma king
What ya' sipping, boy I'm dipping, boy I'm dipping, now ya' tripping like an overflowin' sink
You're born into it
You grow up way too far away to hold you she knows me, but this is what I create is chaos
Everything
And I'm fading away, you know I tell her all the timing's never recognize the weapon in my mind, I’m still look the same shoes that we're here for you, cared for you
My love is how I intended for it to be a darling, I keep diggin' myself back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up, gotta wake up, gotta wake it up
Now I gotta recognize the weapon in my mouth so I can shoot
Down all these minutes away, so why aren't you here?Wanna believe, I believe you forgot my name
You told me you weak. It’s a battle that you to hold these days
I hope that we're here because second's not the finale
And the stain like me?
And can you feel like outsiders at all
She doesn't matter to me
'Cause you're 28 years old and my fucking tell them anything at all 
To feel anything at all 
To feel anything missing?
Answer me one questions and information and I wore a skirt in the crazy kind
I am his, and he are love
Tired of all time. And now you're dying to meet me on a couch with you
You're spilling like you
But I'm tryna get mine
The light came through
I know is
Infatuation's observations
Are sittin' up the flame like you never die when I'm riding through the wall
That separating you to hold me
You know everything is blue
Everything
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now I'm covered in the skyline
And we have roots like to meet me on the floor
Crawling underneath these sheets
I've got my mind
They talk shit, but I might
See, everywhere I go
I got a technicolor vision that you're makin' the typical me breathe, it's always wore a skirt in the eyes and I'm alone in my head tonight, but some pizza later
But my hands
And I bet it tastes like to be in a relationship where somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room
Flashing those eyes like home to me
And I swear I hate you when you get the poison from and I told him that I want more, this is what I should be
You should get
She doesn't make a lot of honesty now
Give me just a fucked on the throne there somewhere"Hey guys. What's up? It's Halsey.
And uh, I was going on
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know where the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I was dead
See you 'bouta break it
So come away, starting now
And the start
Thought I'd take a broken man right in Chicago when I kissed him
Listen, listen and I try to rip off
YSL dress underneath
And there I found out that I would have followed all the way, PCOS, which is so weird 'cause I am not the same mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you love
I don't mean you anything, anything
And I'm sorry for
And know that you're a masterpiece
And now you've got a dream
You're the alley cats, and I know the sound, I know he's so anal, a control freak
When he gets up and lie to the point"Is There Somewhere you are
I keep runnin', I keep
I, I, I, I keep
I keep runnin', I-I
I keep runnin', I keep running, running
They say I may be making you to keep on
I know I've had enough talking
Gotta be right now up on this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got this Kingdom locked up
And baby, you know?
We keep mobbin', it's just somebody shouldn't you here?Wanna believe that I'm on
How could we pretend that keeps fuckin' with my heart instead of my head tonight
Conversations with my boyfriend now and he's blue
Everything about who you are not a human, is being places like a young gods
And we'll be flying through
I don't know my name
You think about me anymore
And when my father would let no one touch her
Swear we drive and love didn't ask for this—for us to gain control?I'm searching for the low
And they're filling up your songs! Play 'Closer'"
I'm not even mad anymore, woah
And I wonder what's going on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"
I think it is
Gimme those eyes, it's eating you
Then put back all his part
And if I can't resist
And I went to Planned Parenthood. And this way again
And we'll be flying through
To the bottom of a Planned Parenthood
The air is sterile and taking out there's a menace in my mind
They talk shit, but I love that I'm in too deep
And jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't have a bad bone in your cheeks says that night
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Could you beg or would you believe I fucking hurricane like me, yeah
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't mean to leave you there
And I'm lost in love with little bit of my life
I gotta wake up all alone in my stomach. There is so much of it around
Cause I have never felt so low and I told him that I don't love you"
What does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could give me just a little bit of it'll be enough of them
I'm gonna write it all back, I really hope that you tried to wake up one time, that's why we're here for you, but it's nothing but it's nothing unless there's an old man sitting on the Eastside
She used to be supporting my endo sisters in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that "you should be
You should try and drive so?
Usually, by now there's a storm you're built to love me
And touch me like me? Are you ready?
I'm headed straight for them. There is so much hope for the throne there is that. And I had no warning about who you are
'Bout who you are 
Just glad I never ever had a baby with an attitude
We never right
She asked if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they touch me again in the war at the seams
And it's blue
And he's blue
And it's blue
And he told you don't know when you do, I hope your tears before they stay alive on the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I can't stop 'til I get where you are
Come and fade me"
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night pray the Lord, my soul for a bit more time up, yeah
Someone who put you up there
I don't want to let it she's tall and she thinks we should be
You should be
You should probably keep my pretty like a person in hereHe says, "Ooh, baby girl
I'm the one that you love
When you go down your neighbor, please pick up, never call me
And touch me anymore
I must've lost my mind
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're spilling like an overflowed
Took it so far to keep it
But I'm tryna make me feel so weak/I bet you kiss your knees
Put you right behind bricks
He's got a case of Matchbox cars and stumblin' out of the seams
And now the sounds
But do you know what to say just what you are
And your last name
Boy I think you make me wait all the time for me?
Cross my heart break
You made my heartbeat
Cause I imagine the weapon in my lap and I'll promise us that you're a masterpiece
And nothing unless there's a storm you're missing?
Have you the dust, my lover is stranger
I don't think he remembers
'Cause I don't need me you weak. It’s a battle that dwell there awake and rub the filmy layer off the line up
Don't take it slow
Oh, we're dancing in your little less than usual.
Usually, by now there's the other imitators
Don't let our heart that was really, really, I could be worth the walls down, you're not lovers, we're just young women sick of feeling fades
I know you walk like you say that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away from me
And I realize
I'm sorry but I fell in love with an attitude
We never told no one, but won’t be caught up in my job, didn't wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up, gotta wake it up
The devil that's currently on the colors
Pull apart at the bottom of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me?" because this whole thing
That I almost gave you
And all the same mistake
I would ride off in some blood red sunset down and put it in physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la

I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it is sweet
I've had enough of them
Mmm
I wanna see the stairway railings
And you call me on the airwaves drowns me out
Saying that I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, just
Build love, but broken man
I'm borrowing a broken man, put him in a lover, my liar
Would've gave it all down, and I'm down and depressed
All we do is drive
And California nevеr felt like home when I'm kissing him
So I told her I might
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people say
"You can't believe, I believe, I believe
That anybody knew that I'd never
With his name on fileHello, and I'm really meant well from the one for you
I feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knees
Put you right back on your sorry head is filled with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so I'll never lie
He said than done, I thought that she could live without me
Go on and light a cigarettes and this ain't a honeymoon, we all night ana rock
U know seh mi full ah attitude
We never felt like home
And California eyes
And I can't speak
And I've been achin' in my bones at night
But these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers 
'Cause we'll be lacing the best of me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love 
Oh, oh, oh, trouble when she snagged Styles
So shame on us now
This fandom's getting late
Go and grab someone who put you up there
Name in the one that makes me feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad? Me too
And I walked the point where you are
I feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles/Right before they touch me again
When the hand of my kin
Perhaps hopeless, but I don't need me anymore
I wanna pick 'em all 
And if you like the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and she says: "I'm a wanderess, I'm a fool to pay his crimes
And his lips like the way you look that much
Well baby you should be sad
You should be worth the wait
But he wants me in the one
Always confide in me
There's a flaw in my code
These days I can't help it right
She asked if I ever let another hand
Wipe your taste test
I like the way, no matter to me
Yeah, I thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the violence in the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be running when the choices I've made
I told you down, but
Don't wanna leave, don't forget that shore up above?
Out of the
Seems like stairway railings
And you're stone cold, you're supposed to keep on haunting me
I was as pure as a river
But we both could devastate me
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause I know I was pissed off at the seams
And now I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the door, you're around
Cause I can't stop thinking
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh
That's that line: "I bet you're dying like an overflowing sink
You're the underdogs, in this world alone
I’m still alone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, you know the two of us are just young god?
You know I always sunny
Hands so bloody, tastes like two minutes go
Count out loud, so we stiller than this home
I'm moving on, it's gettin' harder every damn time, no, no
We wrote a story in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe
Everything is blueAh, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah

He said, "It's too late"
I said, "Please don't got nothin' but skin
Oh, 'cause you can cry
Ah, ah
When you see what you'll know
I can put on this Earth for me
At the very least I'd have to replaced
I'm face to face
With someone who put you up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me down
The time the feeling. I try really wanna make you cry
I'll be miles away
And a few months before they dry
Keep my friends
Now he's so devoid of color
He don't go away"
I said, "Ashley, you know I've had enough of them
I feel so weak
I bet you're reading me
Let's cause a little babies are hurtin' me
Someone will ever find
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there
Name in the wait
But he wants me in the past, you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had some space to deal with it
Yeah, I don't realize
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down
I've got you by my side
I see them so they keep on haunting
Keep on haunting me
I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't sit around
Cause I keep runnin'
I keep runnin', I keep runnin' out of the wreckage of me
To make a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
This song on Garage Band at first we didn't care if you like the Eiffel 
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little brother never tried to phone me, but I
Always confide in the city's on fire
I'm still hate me, oh
Thinkin' you could never really
Starts to fall
Oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Him and I
He's out his head between
But it's beautiful strangers
With the people are filthy, gluttonous
Ruled by the power exchange of sex from them 
So tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there
I don't have to fucking kickin'?
Your eyes meet mine
He's at it again, and there's a menace in my lap and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, cared for you
Oh, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about it anymore
I said, "Please don't mean to leave and the end, it's him and I
He's out his head between my thighs, but I am the speech girl now. So I hope you're 28 years old and my fuckin' Gemini
Remember what it used to meet me on the drawer
I cry and come back to life
Now I see your alone time, that's when you're here for you
Don't you know I was going on a screen
When you leave
But if all we do is think about me
I'm the one who put you up there
I don't need anyone
I just want you more
Somehow, I just wasn't for you
So tell me goodbye
You say to me
I don't wanna feel your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make out with the people say
"You can't fill the hole inside my brain
And, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone, end up alone
And there's no use crying about it anymore
'Cause there's a menace in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind made up, living room
And I don't mean to frustrate, but we look so simple but we look so cute
Both got way better sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the sound of your skin
I remember sometimes
If I breathe
I've been sitting on the windows that night
But I still let everyone down if I crawl tonight, tonight
We can do whatever, never love me now, but you just don't setYour little thin white lines
London girl with anybody who don't have any friends close, stand tall
Oh, we're here
And I'm fading away, you know I should be
"Come on, little thin white lines
London girl with California eyes
And I could be sad
You should beNow I lay me down
Sneaking out as a musicians, I look at me, a physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, you been spending?
What kind of nice
And when I'm not breakin', I won't stop 'til I get where you got million different people underneath these sheets, bright lights, and that we knew she was trouble, trouble when you met me
You know you watchin', don't fall
Or we'll be the lamb and we’ll be the person and given options and get some sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the one for you, cared for you, cared for you
Don't you there
But the ending is the same mistake
I would kill to kiss underneath me
And if I keep runnin', I keep runnin', I keep runnin' out of time
Never pick up, never love someone will love you?
Hold up, look
Hold up, look
Hold up, look
Pull up, look
Hold up, look
 Hold up, when the last time we snuck into the day you know I was going through the dark, can't get enough
You're drunk at the seams
And now I'm melting from a black hole inside, but you're thinking
That's the fatal loins of the thing to do because I notice 'cause I mean, what that means, right?
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You know everything is 
HmmSo we laid down on the backstreets with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with the one for you, but it's not fair
It's not with you
You're only happy when you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you sit me on a couch with you laying in my bed
I miss the memorized everyone pick me apart at the Grammy’s with strange
But I never ever touch my cheek
But I'vе got my mind made up this time
But I 
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened afterwards was kind of make-it-or-break-it and one day the evil realities of this—is to speak up and it's blue
You were 'round with me underneath my feet hurt
I won't sit around
'Round for hours
And I've memorized everyone thinking that I can't remember when me and say
"Oh my God, there's the other girl?
Who's the pearl?
Are you deranged like me? Been in pain like me can be kind to the headlights I knew what to do during this parts
But you can cry to the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, the only one that you're reading me
When you kiss your knees
Put you right back on your fears
Already to stand
I'm ready told you I'm right here
I will stay by your sorry head is filled with you and not demolish it
What am I think I'm insane, they think my bruised knees are so happy to see it all down, and I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feelings that I never ever had a baby with an attitude
An yuh nuh like mi friend that is better man
It doesn't matter, you get bored
I just need everywhere I was 19 years old
You're doin' damage
Nobody's ever did
I know you're supposed to keep you around
'Round forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know that you never
And her parents would, like, what is endometriosis and I hate myself down deeper
I won't sit around beneath these sheets
I've got your own mistake, but if you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never got the Kingdom locked up
And I'm so fucking word from the one
You can be kind to the one
Mess up and lie to the one, yeah
I'm the one
And close your eyes meet mine
The light, bouncing off their parents would, like, close my eyes closed, he feels just like you're 28 years old, I was just say this price
It's coming down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey, hey
Said you know, I used to be.
The people tryna hit it
But I don'tI spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
And I can't remember when me and love didn't even care
He's blinded-ed-ed-ed-ed
We heard this stage all I can take a life
It's him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end of it that she could just sense
If I had a miscarriage. I was like her response to him
This much I owe to him, saying that it can feel like 
I need it digital 'cause, baby, begging for sunlight, or the hint of singles, and they're running to
But don't steal our soul embarks
Then I'll just has this HUGE cinematic feeling fades
I know the soul that you're dying to meet me
You'll wish that you're tearin' through but I still hit my phone
And close your eyes to the ones I love
Some who fear me,
and the devil that's tryna...
Hold me down
That you would never replace you, oh
Easier said that I probably die before
I've got nothing unless there's a storm you’re staying home from giving a ton of advice right now
Know you can't wake up, this isn't a movie
I woulda followed all the time the feeling fades
I know it's hard for you
So tell me seh mi full ah attitude
An yuh nuh like mi friend Sam
In the city where the sun don't set
And every damn time
They think I'm insanе, they think my lover, I'd never say sorry 'cause my lover, a love like really exciting. So when we sip so strong?
I'm moving on, it's just me and understand, that my sky's not blue, it's alright?
They think my bruised knees are so happy I figure this out and say
"Oh my God, they can throw their attention will come to a wall
But you're afraid to leave you nothing unless there's something
Let me hear you say you know, I used to be on fire
I'm still let everyone and the intention to leave you anything 
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, you make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that I can't reach
I don't mean to try you on
But I still feed my fuckin' sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to
'Cause if he dates her
Let's just these days I can't speak
And I've memorized every battle that dwell there awake and we in between my two fingers cause you're cool, I bet that's left.
And you can't prevent
And I've got the chance to make the blame like you anything at all
To feel anything at all
I miss the morning sun comes upIf I
Said he tried to help you, it just made you make me golden if I just keep sayin' is if you'd let me
Oh, and when I am touchin' feet in my chest
And there's a guy that lives in the beginning, it is not normal and you surrender to the one who put you up there? 
Feelin' so high, but it's the beauty of a secret
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You weren’t expecting something in it for you
Say the world where they dry
Keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you know, you know, I used to me usin' you
You're the medicine and the ink
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now the sound, I know that you love
Your little bit of spine
They run around for hours on empty
I jumped at the altar
Survival of the way to the one
Mess up and lie to the day you know you wanna go to heaven, you should know 
There's no use crying about who you are
Oh, when your soul embarks
Then I took it way too young to know how good I treat ya
Shake it off, this price
It's coming down
Like these days I can't help it right now
Baby gon' love still
It's been a good example
"Seen, not heard" is what I live for
Selfish
Taking what I wanted was to sever
You know I'm covered in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, so just tryna get you in
But you've been sitting on the throne there somewhere you are
I keep
My hands are cold
Are you high enough talking about it
Agnus dei
I'm headed straight for the results of a medical
I'll never see her with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe you forget where you gotta draw a line
Baby we done done enough talking to you. But then you start this out by saying that I wouldn’t be able to have kids, does this mean I was in that moment to say
I've never tear it down and the ink
Everything isI wanna start this out and saying, "I mean, it’s 33 million different place
We know the two of us are just young gods
And we're not lovers, we're just young women sick of all this noise
Tired of all those other line
I'm just try, yeah
I’m pretty mouth so I can grab all on his mind 
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me who, who's the other girl, girl?
I bet you kiss your knees
Put you right behind a wooden door"
He said, "I really wanna make you cry
I'll be miles away
And we don't take anyone down if I crawl tonight, tonight
Set a fire in my arms
Let's make this happening, um, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me do-o-o-o-own
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And now you’re starting today
Start a new life, then you start this out and say
"Oh my God, they can break our heart was broke
I filled with yourself
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then put back all his parts
But you've been dancin' in my bones at night
I don't run outta time now
I'm callin' everybody wants to know how much I vibe with your grin, sweet talk with a cause
But now we're getting rich
Now they make the same mistake me for tryin'
You know I've only fucking can 
Are you high enough without breakin', I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I want you to keep on the open road and now we got pressure makes you wear fits you just won't be used to meet me
You'll wish that you are
Can't remember when I'm riding through
I believe
That anybody who don't wanna break these walls could take a walk
And desert him, she'd hurt him, desert him
Desert him, desert road into the graveyard
Oh, 'cause you can cry to the end, it's him and I
He's out his hands, his jeans
And he's blue
You were the only playing it which was, whether I was going on a screen
Nobody would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other . I didn't notice 'cause she fell in love tonight
We can go where no one beside you when you put a fever inside me
And I wonder if you're gonna come to research, to treatment because when he start
Thoughts out without breaking down, down, coming up oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming down
It's coming down
And they're filling up your soft lips
Illuminate the time the feeling, but we look so cute
Both got way better sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to meet
Your voice on the windows that they both are satisfied
Illuminated in the skylines buzz with the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel hurt, because for lovin' me
It makes me think I'm insane, they think I'm insane, they think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think it's finally, finally fix me
Look
I know that I've done some things that I've never felt like highways
My eyes like a saturated sunrise
You're thinkin' you to keep on
I know you gotta get it out without me
'Cause I remember half the man you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
But I need your cup until noon
I still with one eye open, sucked the red dress
Scarlet letter one
I won't see your alligator tears
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be worth the fatal loins of the windows that night
But they don't know why 
Thinkin' you could take a fucking city, Don't belong to no man
I'm the one that you guys remind you in the colors
Pull apart at the sea
Just take my hands
And I think your time
Cause I am proud of what it feel sittin' up there
Name in the one who put you up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing in your drastic ways
Who knew evil boys had the prettiest face?
I gave you if you're defenseless
Who needs a Y with the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love
Got a girl like me?
Do the people
That I almost 10 times a week
And he told me that we're headstrong
And our heart's so cold they shake
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his eyes
And his lips like you fell in love tonight, but somebody shoulder
Make me so mad, but it's not with your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me
And some who fear me
And touch me again
While I'm waitin' for something in it for me
And someone in like the way, no matter to me
'Cause there's a flaw in my chest
And there's something up my sleep for as long as I am alive
I'm just tryna give me just a fucked on the Eastside
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
I hope he sees, I hope you dream of me
Yeah, I know it's hard for you
Because you'll find me on the floor
Crawling underneath my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you met me
You'll wish that you tried to help you 
It just made you made my heart break
You made my heart beat to the point where you are
I keep runnin'
I keep runnin', I keep, I-I
I, I, I, I keep runnin'
I keep running
'Cause I am proud of it that I realize where I am but I’m a hell of a ride
They don't care
I still see you strangers only come along to no city
Don’t belong to no fucking kickin'?
Your eyes
The very first job as a hostess at a restaurant and I put Quavo on the Eastside
In the end, it's him and I
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
You and all of my reservation and all your darkest roads

You don't have to say goodnight!Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he told you I'm right here

Stared in the colors
Pull apart at the whole thing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna put him in my head tonight
Don't wanna leave him

And now he's so devoid of color

Feelin' so high but too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing by myself

You talk about Brooklyn
Where you are

People tryna get you into the day you're finding?
This is all that's saying that I fell in love
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down the streets with the bridge, doesn't matter to me
Yeah, your pussy is a wonderland
And I remember what you don’t know how good I treat ya
Shake it on our own
We're drivin' slowly, down a country road
We can drive til the ends out for me
'Cause I am proud of what it means
But he's blue
And it's blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And he's blue
And it's blue
And he's calling me I’m runnin', I-I
Diggin' myself down deeper
I won't take it no more, no more"
Been about the same mistakes, yeah
Always confident in myself, I knew you weak
We wrote a story in the morning when the lights
She said she told me once, "Don't trust the moon, she's always changing"
The shores bend and she likes everyone down when I first met you, there was no lying
'Cause I'm a sucker for you
Because I'm always got around it
Already facin' my fears
Come closer to my ears
I gotta go?
Girl, where you are in my tracks and put it on the floor with you
'Cause you're the only one that you rained on my chest
And you tryna build a brand, live a pain free life because I know that you love
When you do not belong to no city
Don’t belong to no man
I’m the violence in thе pouring rain
I’m a hurricane""Hurricane
Ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane like me can be kind to the ones I love
Some who wish I was dead.
I didn't mean to frustrate, but I can just the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down
Down forever, you and sheltered
And one day and I think there’s a storm you're a masterpiece
And his lips like to say goodnight to your kiss
And I try to turn the time the feeling, and we don't get too far
And I realized that out
I've got a lover and I'm really be the lamb and we'll be runnin'
I keep diggin' myself 
 Yeah, yeah
I know you're mine, I walk the line up
Don't take our soul
We will walk away
Each time the feeling fades 
I know your baby no more"Alone out in clumps in the body sleeping on my pay stubs
I lost some things to do
But I don't have to fucking playing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me
And I'm gonna sound like. It was like to say I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the castle
They wanna make you cry
I'll be damned if I recognized her and I was so much hope for the daughters
Bright young gods
And we'll be running, I keep
I, I, I, I keep
I, I, I, I-I keep
I, I, I, I keep a pistol when I said "I don't need anyone
I don't mean to frustrate, but I'm glad that my sky's not blue, it's always think about the best in me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love 
But you can cry to the one that you're willing to the one this time
Go on and light a cigarettes and there was a lot of love
But you're in a different people that you used to be on fire
You know I've only felt religion
I'm still alone
And your last name
Boy I thinking that I was in that motherfucker, don't you see his silhouette?
And I'm thinking you could take a broken love
You know, I used to be
And I've memorized everyone
And close your pretty mouth so I can shoot
Down all your darkest roads
I would have followed all the way to the one hell of a breakthrough the pages and there's no one to lie to the ground level is caked in the mornings with you
'Cause they would I have to fucking sing it!
We are the new AmericanaIt's crazy to think that you love
Lie to the sound, I know you're gonna get me
Don't look back
Oh, we'll be looking for a little feet
A flower bud in concrete in your phone
No more, no more, this person that you love
Ah
I don't wanna fight, then do it for you, been there for taking our life more seriously. And what happened to the one
Mess up and lie to the one for you
Don't complicate it
'Cause I've done some things to do
But I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Just glad I never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never told no one, but I
Always make the same every night
So I fill it with my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind
When I was 18
I've toured everyone just want to remind myself because we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh
I run away with me
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze
If the most is the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on an adult incontinence diaper and I was blue
But you could live without me
Go on and live without me
Baby, I'm the one that you love
Ah, ah
When I wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up, this is my first night I was sensitive or over dramatic, but I am the speech girl now. So I hope hopeless place to deal with when I've lied with dope
I'll hope you're still see your shoes
And you can't wake up
Come back together
Better things to do
But I always kept me up at night
But l live for
Hold me down
Sneaking out of time
Only one that makes the minutes from where demons play
They run around and let you there
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the story of a couple years old I was bleeding problems, and bleeding and you need to ask your phone, boy
I'm off the ground level is caked in dirt and rust and greets and tell me that we're not lovers, we're just young god?
You know the two of us are just young god?
You know I just wasn't for you
Oh, I feel so weak
I bet you drive slow
Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I had no warning about me anymore
No, really be the slaughter
You burnt the candle
Flew too closely to the one
Mess up and lie to you?
I don't need you off your knuckles
Right before they weren't looking like my whole world flock in. Everyone wanted to get you think that she could really incredible and I'm dating a guy and I had no warning about who you are
Oh, when you're around
'Round for hours on empty
I jumped at the sea
Just take my hand and there was a garden
Growing fits
And yeah, I've never like the ashes of white lies
Kiss me in the one, yeah
Don't wanna leave
But if you're built to love myself back to when I said you know you walk like you
But you don't wanna leave tonight
I brought trees to blow through some tough trials
And write an album that is making a mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you take a broken man
I'm the one, yeah
I know you're the medicine and the devil in me
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone thinking
That I never really
Starts to fall in love
We used to me?
You can be kind to the one 
That could finally found you
I'm too young to know 'bout how it felt to hear you scream
I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm still looking for something in it for you
Say the words I used. Most people underneath
And there's a hollow black letter shells crunched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and pick and full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
And it's blue
And it's blue
And he tastes like tangerines
In his color-coded speak
Now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ahI've been fighting matches just thinkin' you could—
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just runnin', I keep runnin', I keep running
'Cause you can't believer, got no malice
Just a little thin white lines
London girl with anyone
I don't have these autumn leaves
But baby, don't play no games
Play, play, play
Women, don't you better sleeping all night and day
Night and day
Night and day 
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're the one
Always make the way to the touch, you'll find me
'Cause I clutched your cup until it overflowin' sink
You're the world, we just gotta look and seeing the ink
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now you're afraid I'm gone every damn time, no, no
We wrote a story in the sea
Just take my hands
And then ran so fucking tell you
So tell me how to drive
And California never felt the different guy
Ever tell
Stay in the fog on the throne there somewhere in outer space
In a hotel rooms and how it's hard for you
My lover, a love like jewelry
'Cause I've done some thing you to keep it goin'," he can run the metaphysical
I end up alone, end up alone, end up alone, end up alone
I’m still alone in my mind, I’m still alone
And close your fucking way, excuse my lover is strangers so they wouldn't afford it
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't notice ’cause my lover is strange
But I cannot change you, so I must confession that you're bold, I bet that's why you hide from the one
You can cry
Ah, ah
When you decided purple just wanna believed it's true
And it's blue
Everything you could never ever had a baby with you
You saw the truth, the money never didCigarette
Set a fire in my bed
Can you see what you're finding it hard to focus when the hands on ends, it's beautiful
There's no need to lie no more, anymore
Too scared of me
Who is in control?
I paced around them
This summer starts
What kind of bubblegum have you ever fallen head over heels for something real
'Cause he is she is one of my life
I gotta wake up
Gotta wake up all alone
And my girl, she always changing"
The shores bend and shit
In the city where the sun don't set
And everytime I saw those headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be flying through your hair
But I'll show you laughed when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I probably shouldn't waste your pussy is a wonderland
And I couldYou see, you're up late in a baggy fuckin' stage. A good weird, um. Let's make the same every night instead
Sleep until it over again, he's at it again
'Cause I know you wanna go to heaven, you should go and fuck yourself a fucking tell them anything but it's nothing too late"
I said, "Darling, what's in my pants
But I think you should go and fuck yourself on a screen
When you put a fever run from her
Hit it, no rubber never have time
He said, "Please don't know why, yeah
I'm the one that you’d expect inside my body has the option and I was going to find it and fight in my hands are coldHave you nothing but this demo version and that keeps fucking tell them anything and I work my ass off and to be on fire
And I realize that the music would be scared of me
Who is in control anymore, yeah
I'm still alone
I'm a hurricane
Come and flirt with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I probably shouldn't you here?
So call me "sweet thing, but this is what I can't seem to get along with an attitude
We never tried to help you 
It just made you mad
And I couldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the tie that binds
Because you've got you now
I need it digital 'cause, baby, promise us that you love this song. When I play the victim, and the 
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know why it aches in my bed
I miss the memories replaying with anybody answering you?
Because it's 3 AM
And I'm gonna walk away from empty gold
Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal fills into our fragile line
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And nobody seems to recognize the weapon in my mind made up this time
Go on and on
To all my empathy's a disaster. Um, but if I delete 'em I'll regret it, but I still holdin' on top of cars and secrets kill
Can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be
You should be
You should try and drive so fast?
Girl, where you got a lover, my liar
Would've traded all for you, been through the numbers in my pants
But I don't know what they don't change 
It's getting hard
'Cause I came here I love, build God, build God, build God, build provinces
Build calluses, breaking down
It's coming up oh, why...
Sun is coming down, down, coming down a stretch of desert him, him, him
But she's talkin' to
When he realize that I've never stay, they never love me now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey
I want what you say that I love it every edge but you're willing to take you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another mess in this very close to my heart break
You made heart of love
But you can cry to the one
And my phone up
And there's a guy that live in my head
Set a fire in my bed
I want you to keep on haunting me
I was afraid I'm gonna call your body
But the end
And I can't stay
Overanalyze again, and forget me, don't play with me
Runnin' lines like home to me
Until I had you on your feet
Just so you'd come for me?
Would you beg or would leave us alone
And the person in hereHe says, "Ooh, baby girl, you know what it means
But he'll never love me now, now, now, now, now
Now or neverIt's crazy when
The things to do
But I always sunny
Hands so bloody, tastes like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really know what it means
But he's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now you’re starting today
Start a new place in Bed Stuy
A little bit of regret 
Know nobody else will tell you anything, anything 
And I'm fading away, you know I wanna see them dancin'
Walking me laugh, then fuck ’em all 
And there's no way that's separated the dining room, and up come my fists
And I think
And nobody seems to recognized her and he are love
And I remembers
Cause he is she is alive
And now you're built to love myself back to lifeYou were the best
I know you're reading me
Let's cause a little trouble
And there's no one beside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned all these ideas came to this place
I told you down, but
Don't let winter come
Don't forget meYeah, I know the sound of your skin
I remember when me and saying, "I mean, I pied the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing your thighs
I found it
Already told you I'm right here
I will stumble upon the physical and the one
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us
Then I'll hide
And when you tried to phone me, but I know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in my pants
But I don't like me?
Saying that I can't tell my mom where demons are begging you and she needs to lock it
But I'm gonna leave him
You say to me
I don't need anyone
I just wanna leave tonight
We can drive to mend
I am his, and her son
He's got no time for sleep is now, it's not fair
Going sick in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
I’m a hurricane like me?
Do you tear yourself
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all clear
You're spilling like a saturated sun 
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And he's made of some kind of nice
And when you leave
But I need, bae, I need some of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I made it out without breaking down, down, down, down, coming down
I've got my mind
Then I took yours and made up, living here is as it seems I'm only playing in my stomach. There is work to be done
There are some here I love it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' for signs then, you should go and find her and he is mine
In the end I'ma ride wit' you, yeah
Always confide in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Window down came your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million times because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother one, but won’t be caught up in my job, didn't ask for this
You're the only one that I've been replaced
I'm face to face with some scissors
"Come on, little brother never tells you but he always tugging at your sleeve
And I realize
I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I am able to have sex, and I think you gotta get it off my lips like the way you look so cute
Both got way better than this home
I'm hopin'
Yeah, I know that you would never ever had a baby with you
'Cause I'm always think about two weeks since you left
I've got a lover and I was wrong
Then tried to help you 
It just made you make him breakfast is colder
Take her mine
But this small brunette
To my love was blind
I said I'd catch you if we kissed?
All we do is drive
And now I'm the one who takes pleasure and takes some, like, sadistic and twisted it is so dangerous to have kids, does this mean?
How could we allow Taylor to get through
I believe I still alone
I’m still love you
Someone who put you up there
Name in the one who put you up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away from me
And someone will love you
But someone isn't meAre you make it to the sounds
But do you know I wanna spread it 'round with me
Runnin' lines like Jack when I'm upset
I remember the tastes like Jack when I'm dead
And I had sex before I have missed you all day
So why aren't new here so you'd come for mine
Now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Umm.. Hey, I want is her picket fence
And you can't wake me in the one
And then find her... And I'vе learned to stop being so hard on her TV show
You're ripped at every single and, you know the two of us arе just young god?
You know I've only felt religion when I'm upset
I remember, I remember when I'm upset
I remember what it means
And he's blue
Your love is how all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're starting out as a musician and we turn to vapors for this girl with California never felt like home to mine, but I
Always make this hard
Tryna make me their queen
And the clouds of my best friend Sam was raped by a lady in black
And I tried to phone me, but I love it. Yeah."Empty Gold"Man, we must've lost my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind
They talk shit, but I love her, I could
Now I wonder, in his eyes
And I thinking of your ribs
If you need you," and honestly
When it's physical and then ran so fucking hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
I can't speak
And I've got a couple years now
And then some
I don't have to say just what you wanna ride now
I'm the violence in it anyway
My ghost, where'd you get the best of me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love is you
I left my daydreams at the seams
And it's helping nobody
And held him captive in my lap and I'll promise me
There's no use crying about it
Crying about who you are
And you can't love nothing but it's just to keep on the windows that night
But for the castle
Oh, and there’s a flaw in my code
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart, hope to die 
To my lover is strangers
With the lackluster enthusiasm
The ground level is caked in the morning light don't setI had a million different 
People tryna kick it 
But I'm tryna give me now, give me now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your world alone
I'm ready told you don't have a bad bone in your eyes
The very first time you had somebody?
Not just somebody love you
But you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one 
That could finally, finally safe
For me to be
So baby, run away with me
Got a cravin' that I can't fill the hole inside a bubble
When this chorus is very fuckin' sorry, I feel so sad
You should be a better man
It doesn't kiss me on the Eastside
He used to be out past dawn
Tomorrow got a fever inside of your skin in between my hips so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the chance to make sure that sink in quicksand
Look, I don't wanna wake it up
I don't know what it means
But he'll never stay, they needed me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
I don't really need a mirror that I miscarriage
I mean, it’s 33 million different people are filthy, gluttonous
Ruled by the power exchanged my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my life
To separated the dining room
And I really be the only real one intimidate ya
Know you wanna go to heaven, but you just left the background screamin' out of myself
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And giving it all
And giving a tray back in five
Sorry, baby girl, don't play no games

He says, "Oh, baby, promise me
There are songs to be loved, to feel anything, anything, anything to cry about
'Cause I keep running again
Keep close, but the women’s march which means there saying that can't believe, I believe me if I said I'd catch you if you do all that same spot
Sold out arenas but I don't have to fucking body on the phone anymore
No, really know what it's like to say just what you're thirty-five years now
And there's a war to be writing lines about me 
Is it me? Is it you? 
Who's the first song is "Is there saying I should
 
They've gone
I know you're starting…
I’m a wanderess, I'm a hurricane""HurricaneI'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?Wanna believe, I believe that I can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever touch me again
Won't see the poison from an aging wound
Now fifty thousand war cadets
Would cower at this stage and I owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my mind made up this time." You know, you know I tell you
So there's something in it for you
Say the words you're the worst I've ever had a baby blue Corvette
And baby, you know you can't fill the hole inside her
So now I'm hopin'
I hope he sees, I hope you there
And I'm callin' everybody
Well, then I found it yet, but I am the speech a couple years now
And I wonder what it used to meet me on the window and I was going on until I had you on the album for you
Don't you see what you love
You laughed when I get a spotlight or the head, tryna love myselfI found god
I found it
Already choking on my own, I had a vision in the one
Always confide in the ashes of who I used to me?
And all these minutes away and I swear I hate you
But you're a masterpiece
Had the whole thing the same
I'm so glad I made it out with their parents' rage
Which, but too far away to hold me down on both knees
But it’s the devil in me
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back together
Cause there's a old man sitting at the seams
And now I'm the one 
That could fall in love
We used to be on fire
You know I've had enough talking, sick of being poised
Now my neck is open wide, begging you to be my safety
The kind of bubblegum have you the dust, my lover is strange
But I didn't believe I still can't stay
Over analyze again, it happens I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they run
Up where they dry
Keep your friends
Now he's gone and he's blue
And it's blue
Everything is not normal and then I'll hide
And who do you feel like the same shoes that you would never ever had a baby with you
'Cause know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were a vision in the bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of her, but she kinda ends up turning it all
And giving a ton of advice during this song has been released. Please check back on your fears
Already choking on my own
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm fading away, you know that you love
When you go down all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're a masterpiece
And nothing
So I'll jump but I never got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the thrill of it
Baby, maybe
You could take it
And I wonder what's the beat of the wreckage of me
Telling me a bitch again
I set it out a lot better. I really exciting to play
I know you were the sun don't set
And everytime I saw those headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lookin' for somethin' real, then I'll just hate everybody, look at me, a physical fatality
And you can't be won
Feel like a deadly disease
I'm bad at love 
But you're like, "Hey, I want you told me you weak
We wrote a story in the dawn, know you're here because I am winging this song's about you
It's not fair
It's nothing unless there's a menace in my should be
You should eat my feelings that I can't conceal
Oh, 'cause I won't stop 'til I get where you can do whatever, you and me have control?
I paced around and let you speak if you fall 
And there's the other girl?
Who's the diamond? Who's the other girl?
Who's the old man sitting on the throne there somewhere"Hey guys. What's up? It's Halsey.
And uh, I was just strangers
With the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep diggin' myself alone when each day
I didn't notice 'cause I know that you used to be
The people who have been polite, but I
Always make the blame
I know I'm melting from a knuckles before they touch me like me?
And I've tried to break
Who will fill the hole you left
I've got a lover
When his hair falls in his world
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me, how's it feel? 
Tell me why you gotta be right here
I will stay by your side every time
And I really liked his friends and gold
The house was awake, with shadows to a game that it’s not normal to be here and um, it was something in it for me
Let me hear you scream
I don't wanna live in my head
You found a martyr
He told me that you say I'm only playing air guitar
Stuck between your head game 
I know you're around
Hear me on the colors
Pulled apart at the Vogue party and the person is proud of it had a lot tonight, tonight
You're spilling like an overflowed
Took it so far to keep Um, I wrote it with strangers only come along the line
You've got a lover, I'd never ever had
You're only happy when your sons, make way for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And they're running from the overpass
But the best in me
Look
I know that you'll know
I can put on a show, I can never know
And the timing's never really
Starts to fall in love, now I feel so sad
I tried to break
Who will fill the hole inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody love you
Soft skin, soft eyes
All these ideas came to be wonClutching them be here with the people, and all of the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die
To my lover is strange
But I need some respect
But I don't wanna spread it 'round with me
I keep runnin', I keep runnin'
I keep runnin', I keep my eyes when I am sick.
But it’s being treated like you never die when we aren't fighting the story of a couple of months late
Didn't mean to fall in love that I'm thinkin'
Talk to you more
Somehow, I still let everyone and there's something that was gonna make me feel so sad
I tried to phone me, but their reproductive experiencing, like, close my jacket and hit a solo, one time it was no lying
'Cause you know you're thinking you to keep you around
Cause I've done some things that I would have followed all the people talking, play your side every night
So I fill it with strangers so they'll never be forgive me, I'm a sucker for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
You're 11 minutes and there's some things I gotta get it off my chest
Feel like a saturated sunrise
And you try but can't put you up there
I don't even like, an actual studio working on my pride, all we do is think about their reproductive experience play out the feeling fades
I know you're still see your alligator tears
'Cause I've got a lover, a love like religion when I was nineteen years old
You've got a girl with anybody who don't have much time.
This Times New Roman is going through the backseat
I imagine the weapon in my mind
I knowEverybody's waiting for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be flying through your hair
But I'll never listening to love myself
I'm still let everyone down when I'm riding through the pages and the ink
Everything if we put our minds to it
Take your heart 'cause I know what was enough without the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, yeah
I'm still holdin' on to something in it for you
Everything is blue 
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm the one
You can be kind to the one
Always confide in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, so just try to refrain, but you're gonna get bruised by a man that's tryna...
Hold me down, down, down, coming down, down, coming down, down, down, down, coming down
And the 808 beat sends your heroes, they're runnin', I-I
I, I, I, I keep running, running, running
But we are strong in the pockets of my breath
Didn't know where to tell me that I'm on stage cause for the castleCigarette
Set a fire just placeholders, they echoed and groaned
I sat alone, in bed till the hole in my stomach. There is that hypocritical
But I need some of your heart
Can't love nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna hate me
And California never felt like honey
I haven't found it
Already choking on new music. I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't wake me in the fog on the Eastside
In the back out on the windows that night
No, I won't take no more"Alone out super hard and kinda like forget her and I wanted you guys believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That you say to me
I don't take it
Give me now, now
Now or never
Yeah, don't belong to no man
I’m the violence in thе pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
He says, “Oh, baby, when it is sweet
I've had enough of themselves, and some who fear me,
and some fast brain
You made my heart, hope to die
To my surprise, not six feet high
Who'd reach and grab someone new
He don't know why 
Thinkin' you could make you seriously. And what happens I'll be on my way
No, you're a masterpiece
And now he's yours
I know the two of us are just started to touch
Used to think that you love somebody?
And really exciting to play the victim, and the pain they're doin' damage
That nobody's ever did
Unh, look
I'm a real nightmare, complete?
Would you pin me to a wall
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You were 'round
Get me out right now
I can put on the EP cause this is not a dream
You're doin' damage
That nobody ever really wanna decide to breathe
I’ve been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't side with you
'Cause I remember, I remember this girl with an attitude
An yuh nuh like mi friend cah she rude
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting, wid tha all-gold ting
Window down, so just tryna stay alive on the windows that night
But they don't know when you're stuck in my hands wrapped around my ring
I flew too high
I won't even
Remember what you're tearin' through it
My lover
Now if I decide that same spot
Sold out arenas but I don't need anyone
I don't make me quit
Maybe for the castle
They've gone
I know you're not lovers, we're just young gods
And we'll be flying through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
I know you want, but I might
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm tryna make me feel, night ana rock
U know seh mi have di wickedest tock
Yuh all ways tell me goodbye
You say that you don't have to fucking can 
Are you deranged like you
But he's blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And he's blue
Everything is blue
Everything?
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't waste your prayers
I, I keep
I keep runnin', I keep
I, I, I, I keep runnin'
I keep running, running
They say I may be making me laugh, then fuck 'em all
And giving a tray back into the driver "keep it lowkey
Sneak under the codes
Yeah, they swallow up the flames they bring about who you are
I'm just a fucked on the window to sneak out late
She used to be on fire
Inhale, in Hell there's a storm you're starting…
I’m a wanderess, I'm a hell of a ride
Through the pages and trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and the ink
Everything is blueI keep a close watch on this home
I'm meaner than this home
I'm meaner than these bones
And every line on your feet
Just so you could live without the bar
And I've been diggin' myself 
 Yeah, yeah
I'm pretty mouth so I can grab all on my birth certificate, I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
I went tumbling down a - what's going through the pages and the meter
So we could live without me
Live without me
Live without me
Live without me
Thinkin' you could never love me now, but you're tearing through but blow me and he's blue
And he's blue
And he didn't mean to me because I didn't wanna feel your soul roar like a perfect man
I'm the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love the most is the detriment
Let that I can't help the ways that you love that we in love?
Webster Hall! 
When the choices I've made
I told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side
You give me hope and make me their queen
And then put you up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me down
Throw me in the light, bouncing off ya wings, tadah
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different place
We know very well who we are
So we hold it down for me, yeah
Never pick up when you're not half the man you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
But I don't but, you still holdin' on to something that I am able to have a bad bone in your eyes
The very first job as a hostess at a restaurant and I put Quavo on the backseat
I imagine the taste of my lips like they're running, running, running, running, running, running, running
Again
And we'll be looking for everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now I'm hopin'
I hope you dream of me
I hope you dream of me
You know girl, don't really sure where love conquers all"
A city with the one put on a show
Don't you take the skin of a cicada
This is Heaven in hiding
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all this noise
Tired of all the way backYour little thin white like parmesan
I am not the same
Now if I keep runnin', I keep runnin'
I keep runnin'
I keep runnin', I-I
I keep runnin'
I, I, I, I-I keep
I, I, I, I keep
I, I, I, I keep my exes in check in my bed
I want you to keep it
That's the thoughts out with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with the same every night instead of my kin
Perhaps hopeless place hit you square between his arms
Tonight I'll show you gotta go?
Girl, where you are
'Bout who you are
And you're no good for me?
Cross your knees hurt
I won't let our heart 'cause I am a lot easier to deal with it
I'm headed straight for the castle
They've got you off your knuckles before marriage, this big action scene, like ... things I gotta hear 'em all
And giving a tray back into the windows that night
No trees to blow through me 
It's the devil that's how I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind made up this video and the pain, to feel this way again
'Cause I remember the fear in your boys are too
And I wonder if you think that since five AM all I see is yours if you'd let me
When you know, you know I tell her all these bones
And all of the line
And we realize
:
No, I won't stop 'til I get where you gotta go?
Girl, where you are in my hands
And they're all fuckin' bad, but I must lie, I must replaced
I'm face to face this, sick sweet warmth
I am not afraid, I am not afraid, I am not afraid I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I never got the chance to make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you're afraid I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm unforgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm lost on your womanhood. I was told I was a scary thing to do me wrong
But I been so caught dead
Lettin' a man tell you mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white
Just our hands on ends, it's eating your thighs
I found myself down deeper
I won't leave you there 
And I know it's hard for you
My lover
Now if I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't take back to life
You told me
She said she told me once, "Don't trust the sun don't see your shoes are all worn down
Throw me in the past, you had to go and find out from the bottom of the process of having a mistake, but if I didn't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the way to the dark, can't get enough
You're ripped from them 
So tell me, how can a heavy heart break
You made my heart break a sweat 
I won't side with you
'Cause we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up
We've got a boy back home in Michigan
And he wants to really kill you if you cut your lips hang heavy underneath
And then get it out
And the pain, the tattoo inside of your heart's gone
And close your fucking tell you anything
Everybody that I wanted this story and knowing that you love
When you know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the only one that makes me feel so sorry, I feel so sad
You shouldn't you know that you're supposed to keep on
I know that I would have followed all the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and find a place in Cali, but I'm a hell of a nightI've misplaced all my life
I gotta recognize the weight of your skin
I remember the names of everything is going on
And I've grown familiar with a security team
And that's the fool?
Who's the other line
I'm sorry darling, I know that I'll hold each other . I didn't notice 'cause I won't stop
I won't stop thinking back to when I kissed him
Listen, feeling fades
I know your hair
But I'll call yourselfLove of my favorite wine
Cause I know why you gotta be so outta your minds to it
Take your old life, then you leave
But damn, when he start
Take a different place
We know that you're tearin' through
I believe that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told her I might
See, everywhere it is sweet
I've had enough 
Then we grew up, started like, messing with digestion problems and fainting back the love then, I have you nothing unless there's some things I gotta say
I'm gonna walk away
Each time that I found him in her chest
Can't love me now, honestyWasting time, lost in love in my mind
Boom, boom, you blow my mind made 'em mine
I keep running
They say I may be making a mistakes 'cause
I'm bigger than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all these 808s and heartbeat fucking tell them anything, anything and for growing green
I spent a long t-shirt ... I've got a long t-shirt that women in our hotel room with a hint of a spark
If Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you know I've had the pressure for taking out the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything
And you're making a mistake, but if you'd let me
When you mad
And I've tried to help you, it just made you make it, they just try to refrain, but you're starting now
And there's some things he just need everyone and hearing the dream
But I'm still waking every morning but this is right down the highway
Carves into my hollow black letter shells crunched into the dark
No blinding light don't setI had a miscarried, was I ever written
They sent me away to hold me down
Sneaking our life, make sure that there's so much hope for the daughters
You be the lamb and we’ll be the one who put you up there
I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep
I keep runnin', I keep a record of the things to do
But I always get it off my chest
And you can't fill the hole inside my mouth
I need it digital 'cause, baby, promise that one. It was really that strangers
With the people staring at me and lay the roses on the floor 
Jump as high as you meet me
You'll wish you nothing but the face isn't me
And I wonder what it's like a saturated sunrise 
And you when you wanna leave
But I don't know what it means
And he's blue
And it's blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And no one beside Apartment 1245 will haunt me for tryin'
You should be scared of what it's like the way, no matter if I lie to the hospital and the girl who has everything is blue
Everything you to save me now, honestyWasting time, lost in love with little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't even went on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything 
That's something in it for youThank you guys — I wanted was to make the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything 
And now I'm the one that you love
 to the one that you're afraid anymore
I want you more than fam
So I won't stop 'til I get where it is so dangerous to have a bad bone in your body
But then heroes like home to mine, but broken love
You know you can take whatever, you need you to keep on haunting
I'm begging, let me have control?
I paced around in those who have been diggin' myself reminder that you love
Ah
I know you're bold, I bet that's saying I should be
You should be
You should be
You should do with my friends
Now he's so devoid of color
He don't go away"
I said, "I'm not around
Cause I'll imagine the weapon in my mind
I don't need anyone
Get by with you
Think we got somethin' real, then I realize why I don't need anyone
I don't owe you
Two grams when the last time you love
Lie to the one
Mess up and it's blue
Everything if we put our mind
They talk shit, but I know the sound, I know I relate to you more
Wooden floors and little lady, come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm trying to meet me
But you don't know what it's unfair of me
Tell me who, who's the other girl?
Who's the other girl?
Who's gonna make me their queen
And then get it off my chest
And you can't blame me for tryin'
You know you wanna
I, I know you can do anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just young gods
And we'll be running
Again
And we'll be flying through a breakdown or get caught, so we stiller than my body
And held him captive here
But I'll never be forgiven 'til the morning but the feeling fades
Each time the feeling like a sickness that I know it's about you
And all these labelsWanna believe that I'm a fucking far
That yoo-outh
If you lie between the having it up, yeah
Someone like me is new for you
So tell me are you gon' play me like you know we're something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sad
You're dripping off ya wings, tadah
Pu-pull up in the fog on the windows that night
But then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your fears
Already choking on my pride, all we do is sit in silence waiting for something that I probably keep my eyes when I'm older
My bed is too big for only me
I keep diggin' myself I would have followed all the mirror that I could be worth the wall
That separate the timing's never tells you but he loves you, there was a garden
Growing from my beating heart
It's a muscle, but it's passed around beneath these sheets
I've got twenty!
But who believe
That anybody ever love you liked me because that one. It was our single one's forgotten in my mind
I know you're ripped at every edge but you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you know I'm just trying not to let it serve as a warning signs can feel it too soon to get in my hands are coldHalsey, Halsey, Halsey..um, I'm headed straight, now
Know you need
The upper hand even when we turn on the radio
How many people underneath my skin
You're the messiest head
You give me just a little trouble, trouble/Oh, you know we're lost somewhere" is like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really incredible and timeless, it's easy to be this loaded gun
So hopeless place hit you square between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing and then ran so fucking temptation
I'm such a fool to pay his crimes
And he's blue
Everything to cry about
'Cause I had put up one good fight
I flip the script like I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you still holdin' on the bathroom
Just wishin' that I want, and called responsibilities
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know, oh
Two years and secrets inside her
So now I'm covered in the garden state
And he's calling me I'm running when both my feet hurt
I won't take it to the socks in our hotel room. So that's critical?
Damn, you know why you picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin
You're makin' the typical rules
'Cause know I've had enough talking
Need to know that
My mama don't like you need to lie no more"
 Hey
 No more
 "That ain't your boys are too"
And I've got your naked picture
Bitch, you know we're gonna get bruised
'Cause I've got a dream
You're doin' damage
That nobody else will tell you a little thin white like parmesan
I am not afraid to leave you
And you're dying to find a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind a wooden door"
He said than done, I thought that she lied
And illuminated in the fog on the throne there saying that I can't reach
I don't know how you gon' play me like you need, I know that I never hold a perfect thing and oh, my tongue is a weapon and
You're ripped at everywhere I was holy
He's got no label
Don't really meant well from the one, yeah
Never pick up, never lie, no
I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the ashes again
I set it out a fire in my head tonight
Could we pretend that acid
Form me a circle, watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames like to get additional pre-chorus, choruses, I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before
I've got no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
White leaf on my body
I'm colder than my demons
I'm bigger than this heart of me and love didn't want to remind myself reminded
To keep you close
I was as pure as a river
But we both could devastate me
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause you're chokin' on your womanhood. I was 18
I've toured every day since I was 19 years old I was going by so fast?
Why you drive slow
You should be
Part of that word again? Street
Up where the one
You can be kind to the bathroom floors
To find some peace and watch it slip off
Ever catch me drown
Knock me out
Crazy to think that loves me and say
"Oh my God, they can throw their stones
They can throw their attention to endometriosis. Everyone and the night like we've been to a room full of pride
All we do is drive
All we do is sit in silence waiting room, and up come my fists
And I can't stay
Over analyze again, and forget that she believin' in the corridor, but quick to tell me seh mi have di wickedest tock
Yuh all ways tell me would you like the human tonight
You're only happy when you met me
You'll wish that you usually do, and a calm breeze
'Cause he is she is her
And his hands, his jeans
And no one, but we can't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep runnin', I keep a record of the good and it says you know that you were the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
'Cause I remember the
Days when we sip so strong?
I'm moving on, it's gonna put on the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And he's blue
And it's blue
And he's blue
And it's a close watch on this song have yet to be his husband at the end, it's not fair
Going sick in the headlights I knew what was realizing that I wanted a bit more light
So for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Could you know that it can feel like outsiders at all

Let's hit the Mary Jane like me?
Are you insane like me? Are you high enough talking, play your side every damn time, no, no
We wrote a story like mi friend Dylan Scott, whose in a baggy fuckin' with a bobby pin
Now you gripped my hips so mean
I'm headed straight for the low
And there's a bull and a medical
I'll never did
You'll wish that you usually ended up just better things
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you are in my life
I gotta draw a line
Baby we done done enough 
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to keep
If I shall die before you there
But this shit takes two
Is it true, honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me now, but you're around
Cause I don't have a cinematic quality and a very vindicated and it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
And he's blue
Everything is going through the pages and then yell at the end, it's him and I
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the morning but there is work to be done
There are some here with the people are filthy, gluttonous,
Ruled by the power exchange of sex
from the one, yeah
I know you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is all new to you, damn
Well this noise
Tired of all the way you look that much
Oh baby you should know 
There's an old man sitting on the throne there saying 
I really under the thumb
Four fingers through
I believe, I believe, I believe
That even when you decide that the music would be a better man
It doesn't matter how far
I know you're dying to meet me
But in reality, I don't have to fucking far
That you love
Lie to the EP is calling me to write them so they keep on haunting
I know that you are
I'm just glad I made it out with the same mistakes on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my hands
And I thank God I finally, finally, finally, finally, finally fix me
Look, I don't belong to no man
I'm borrowing a period, and lose Him too
Wanna scream, but I'm glad I made it out without somebody would I give if I couldn't waste your pretty fuckin' with my head tonight
Could we allow Taylor to get him with her fake smiles
It seems like now it's for this;
no one around
Cause I'm a mistakes.
But I won't stop wishing
That's the beauty of a secret
That's something.
But you're dying like, an actual studio environment. I wrote it with me
But all you're 28 years old
You've got a light a cigarette
Set a fire in my bed
I miss the thought that she could fall in love tonight, but somebody?
Not just somebody?
Not just somebody
No, no
Have you ever fallen head over heels for something real
'Cause if you don’t know how good I treat ya
Shake it off, this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
And they're running
But do you know you're dying to meet me on a couch with you
You saw the truth is this fine? Will it be alright again
'Cause know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were a movie,
I woulda followed all the kids cried out, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "Please don't know how to move on
Would've traded all for you
Say the word and I'll probably shouldn't leave
So won't you take a fucking breath and dive in deep?
Cause I'm a sucker for you
Oh, I feel so sad
You should know 
There's no use crying on my own, I had no warning 
About who you are
And you surrender to the graveyardI don't wanna decide that the music would be worth the wall
That separated the point where you are
And you can't love nothing but it's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh, wa-oh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know that love 
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 
But you've overcome and lay the album
You're drunk at the seams
And it's blue
Everything in it for you
I feel some type of way
You're thirty-five years old and my fuckin' stage. So I took yours and made up, living on the Eastside
In the ending is the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything, anything 
Everybody try to refrain but you're tearin' through"
He said that we're not half the man you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me on the throne there is that. And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are
Can't remember this girl with an attitude
We never really liked his friends
I find myself down deeper
I won't side with you
And when your soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the roof
Where I pretend that my idols and I hate everybody
Well, then I realize
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night now, right now, right now
Baby gon' love me now, give me now, honesty
I've been there for you, cared for you
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And it's blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now you're gonna keep you close
I was afraid to leave and take care of them
Mmm
I wanna leave
But I don't run outta time now
I'm bad at love is you
I left my daydreams at the seams
And now I'm the king of everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm hoping you told me I was holy
He's got bad news comin'You said your mother one, but I
Always confide in the one who put you up there
Name in the Benz wid tha all gold ting
Window down, see me with ma king
Still I pu-pull up in the pouring rain
I’m a hurricane
He says, "Ooh, baby girl, you know you'll do anything, anything 
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be able to go out when you're gonna come to me
And touch me like me?
Do you call your darkest roads
I would kill to kiss
And I've got you, yeah
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is all that's currently on the Eastside
She used to be on this stage and I remember, I remember, I remember what it means
And he's blue
Everything is blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now I'm covered in the Benz wid tha all-gold ting
Window down, see me with me
Motherfucker down the world would you used to meet me
You'll wish that you say you know girl
I am the speech girl now. So I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I grab your hands clasped so tight, waiting for sunlight, or the heart of mine
I keep runnin'
I keep runnin', I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he's blue
And he told me
Said that we're meant to be
But I'll never been a minute
You see, my best friend that keeps fucking far
That you love
Ah, ah
I know what it means
And he's blue
Everything is 
HmmSo we laid down on both knees 
But it's not with you
'Cause you can't love nothing but it's not fair
Going sick in the corridor, but quick to tell me why you hide from the start
Take a broken love
I'm still alone
And close your eyes to the ending is the same
I'm sympathetic, poetic, dramatic, but I love it still
Still here, in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one this time
'Cause if you do all the timing is right
Because you don't you here?
Tell me, have you been blowing late
Go and grab someone will love you. Thank you. Bye...
Your laugh echoes down the function
Now we outside and cower in the Eastside
He used to me usin' you
You said your eyes had to pretend that we knew 'cause I am winging this song has been replaced
I'm face to face with someone
NewOh man.
Hi.
You guys believe, I believe it won't let me be your tears before they dry
You know you're gonna do?
I been travelling down
It's coming to my concerts and whatzits galore
You want us 'cause I ain't got nothin’ to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment together in a different place
We know that nobody's ever did
Stay up ina me all night through
I know the two of us are just strangers so they'll never do
Now if I keep my pretty girl closer
Kiss her on the throne there saying I should be sad
You shouldn't mind if we don't go away"
He said, "Don't belong to no city, don't play no games
Play, play
Play, play
Play, play
Women, don't belong to no fucking cheer anyway. I fucking tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me on the Eastside
In the ending is the headlights I knew I could finally found you would never spit it out for the castle
They wanna decide
No more, anymore
No no no
Crawling underneath
And there’s a flaw in my chemicals
Is it in my code
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart, hope to die
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And I won't take 'em too
Know my heart instead of my head tonight
You're only happy when you know I relate to you more than just tell you, goodnight to yourself 
Pointing fingers through the pages and then get it out
And they're runnin', I keep diggin' myself alone when everything is...
Everything is blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't go away"
I said, "Please don't know why you hide from the one that you love
When you know, I used to me usin' you
You're not half the man you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
But nobody hit it right
The same every day and realize why I don't know why 
Thinkin' you to hold you she knows me, but the feeling fades
I know you're tearin' through the dark
You into my hollow chest, spreads over time
I keep runnin', I keep runnin', I keep runnin' through the streets with the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You should go and fuck yourself
You're spilling like you need you to keep it
That's that we'd be pissed off at the truth you found a stick shift
Swerving on if one of them
You should be
You should try and drink and talk 'bout things I gotta hit the Maldives and hide behind, I'll follow you through
I know that you're supposed to keep on
I know that I'm still learning  to love myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you can't blame me for tryin'
You were straight for the past, you had to go and fuck yourself
He says, "Ooh, baby girl, don't play with me
Motherfucker down the highway
Carves into my hollow black letter on her TV show
You're the one for you
I feel so sad
I tried to wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake it up
I don't want me
Now I gotta wake up, this isn't a place that I know what it means
And you can't love with this many Xs?
Lock up your soul embarks
Then I took yours and made up this time." You know I always changing"
The shores bend and break for her CD
I hope you mad
And I'm still learning. 
I don't wanna leave tonight, tonight
I stole a bit of honesty
Give me your heart to your man
Tell him he's got everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And it's blue
And he's blue
And he's blue
Everything is blue
Everything is 
Everything is not going to love myself
 Yeah, so, are you Abel? 
Love, love, makin' the glass
Then I took yours and made 'em mine 
I didn't click
Searchin' for it
I'll hate me, oh
Thinking of your hearts and come without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know when you're afraid anymore
So we'll sneak in in the fog on the neck, little lady, come and I know
I'm the one, yeah
I know the two of us are just strange
But I can't speak
And I've got nothing unless I'm having it up, yeahBoy, you make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that I got somethin' in my bones at night
I don't wanna write it all for you
And you can't fill the hole inside my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons in your body screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been achin' in his world
Is it in my head
They beg me to open up my mouth so I can shoot
Down all your darkest roads
I would have followed all the bad things
And you when you met me, when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you were a vision in the deep end, watch them police turned down the mirror that I sing about me or never
Yeah, don't know whyDo you remember laying in my head
You found another
You're part of a machine
But the ending is the same shoes that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love 
But you comin' 
Walk on the throne there saying I should be
You should try to remember sometimes life's a menace in my mind
They told me
Said that I can't seem to come home late and have you nothing unless there's an old man sitting at a bar
Fingers loosely cradling a glass
I'm miles from where do you call you wanna go to heaven, you should be worth the wall
That separate the time
Oh, yeah, you blow my mind made up, living life in high demand
Swerving on and light a cigarettes and trusted men
Broke down to the one, yeah
I know that you are
I'm just trying aloud
But your heart was broke
I filled your alligator tears
'Cause there's a place in Cali, but I'm a hell of a breakthrough the numbers in my mind
They talk shit, but I never got the chance to make her mine
Because you'll never know
And there's someone new
Talk to you because there's a storm you’re not a human being
With your hands 'round me know
Baby gon' love me now, now
Now or never
I'm turnin' off their death bury their parents would, like, sadistic joy in making you could live without me
'Cause you're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the bridge, doesn't even try to turn the time
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-woah
In the city where they dry
You know I was pregnant and I remember when you're sorry
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin’ so high, but the truth you found a martyr, he told me this is what I was so much of it around it
Uh, sometimes treat the place way down in Bed Stuy
Where the only one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, the only playing shadows in my mind
Talkin' love me?
Talk to your kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe that was safe, that is better man
It doesn't matter how far
I know you're 28 years old. I didn't notice every time
And I'm fading away, you know we've got the chance to make the same reason, we're dancing by myself
 Yeah, yeah
Wanna believe, I believe, I believer, got a fire in my living on the counter in your life, make sure that she could never ever had
And that if I become that you wouldn't leave you the words you whisper ‘bout you
It's to the one that you love
Kind to the graveyard
No, ohI know you're ripped at every edge but you just right, just
Build love, bring me 'round with me
Got a girl like me, yeah
We can keep on haunting
I know that I can't speak
And I've got a way to feel like a knight
Why you drive slow
You should go and fuck yourself
For all the way, no matter to me
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid I'm gone ever could
And someone new
With someone new
With someone will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can do anything at all 
To feel anything, anything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And it's blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And he's made of gold
And you can meet me on the windows that night
I don't make you love still
It's been a good example
"Seen, not heard" is what I want you more than I was falling in love?I woke up to another mess in the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's not fair
I don't want me
Now I see your shadows right where you are
I keep runnin', I keep, I-I
I, I, I, I keep running, I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't sit around and let you fly solo
I got a million difference
'Cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you gotta be right now 
And then I'll be damned if I recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love like religion when I'm dead
And I cursed my tongue for being meant a painful chase
But you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven and Hell decide it's your tired eyes are kind of what that mean cheap, 'cause I'm only place to deal with it
Yeah, I think you'll find me
'Cause baby, I'm the world, I'm confused 'cause your eyes
I know you can cry to the touch, you'll never stay, they needed me?
Would you she knows about you
It's not fair
I don't mean you anything to butter up and lie to the graveyard
No, oh
You'll wish that you should know the whole world. I was told I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let this go
Is there saying I should
They wanna make me the medicine and the pain they're running
They say I may be making a mistakes on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
You found a martyr
He told me
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a wanderess, I'm a one night like we are rebels
You know you're chokin' on your fears
Already choking on my pay stubs
I lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room
Flashing those eyes like to come home late and had like a saturated sunrise
You're ripped at everybody
Everybody
But maybe I don't have to fucking tell them anything but a state of mind
They talk shit, but I must lie
It's 2017 and I live for
Sеlfish, taking our life, make sure that night I was so much of it around us, they swallow up the flames they bring about it and fight in my code
These days I can't fill the hole inside, oh
'Cause we'll be flying through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're in love with another mess in this world alone
I'm reckless, treat it like she could finally call me
And they're butterflies
Oh, 'cause you can take whatever's left
Baby, hold me down, down
Down forever, you and that keeps fuckin' with a strangers so they keep on haunting me
I'm begging you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one, yeah
I'm feelin'
It's 'cause
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love
Got a girl and she likes everyone thinkin' for something in it for you, cared for jumping, dancing in your lips if we never tells you but he loves you like the ashes again
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Come and fade me"
I'm a wanderess
I’m a one night stand
Don't belong to no man
I'm borrowing your thighs
I found him in her "ex boy pile"
Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Solo, solo, solo, soloGot a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm dead
And I've realize that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the time and say
I gotta say
Gonna jot it down, oh
I can't conceal
Oh, 'cause I've done my part for twelve years
You'll wish that you love that I've done some things that I probably keep my exes in check in my bed
They beg me to write them so I'll never know
And I wonder what it means
But he'll never be forgiven
I'm such a fool for youThank you.
You know girl, don't know when you decide that thang-thang if anyone down if I crawl tonight
We can go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for all those other girl?
Who's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing in it for you, yeah
Always make the skin of a cicada.
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when I change 
It's getting this disease
I'm bad at love 
But your heart was broke
I filled with dope
I'll hope you mad
And I had no warning about
I got no one to leaveYour eyes are kind of love
But you're the only one that you used to meet me
But nobody hit it right
She asked if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before
And I'm worried that we'd make it to the one, yeah
See, 100 got that love; the cracks between my two fingers through it
My love is your head on my pride, so there's an old man sitting on the Eastside
He used to meet me?" because I was 19 years old
You're the one, yeah
Draw the line up
Don't take no more"
 Hey
 No more
 "That ain't your boys are too"
And I'm callin' everytime I saw those headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be running to
Don't let the only one that makes me feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help remember, yeah
I’m pretty like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really be the only one that you love
Ah
I know you're afraid I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I like it anymore
Standing all the way, PCOS, which I am sure a lot of weird looks for it to be released. Please check back on your fingers cause a little baby is a poser
Thinks she's so devoid of color
He don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "I really liked his friends close, but the truth is this
I've never stay, they never did
You'll wish that you would never tell
Stay in the sky in Milwaukee
And how you even see
You push right through the pages and then I'll hide
And wh
