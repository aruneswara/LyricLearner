her grandma told her;
"Townes, better swim before you go
Oh, tell me that you're the end of June
I want her long blonde hair
I want you and how we don't talk about you
And there's not a drink that's what I like about it
She's an angel, only angel
I must admit when he's sorry
Don't call me 
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !She worked her way through fire for you
I don't wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high

If I'm shinin', everybody gonna stick with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild

Wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
I hope you know where we're getting hard not to act a fool
Sunflower, sunflower, sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower 
I couldn't want you more than friends
What you don’t know why
I don't know who you are
Know who you are? 
Shine, I'm not your face, there’s only so much I can taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a stitch is
I hope you can see, the shape that I love
The only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only one who's been in love with me, and I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause we don't know who you're tryna be friends, I know
And promises are broken glass
This bed was never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We’re still young
We don't say what I like about it
She's an angel, only angel
She is an angel, my only angelTwo, three, four
Meet me in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my DMs, what?
Way more to do?
Just let me know, I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the door
Hoping you'll never know what to do
She , she's the first one that I think he wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna make you feel just fine
I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! 
Don’t know nothing she can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling that you're so golden
I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my juice, blame it on my juice
Somebody come get your man
I think I'm gonna dream of how you ride it
If you go without invitations
How could you ever say what I like about it
She's a good girl
Feels so good
She feels so good, she feels so good
She's got a book for every single time
And things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da
All the light
Shine, step into the deep end
And if we're here long enough
And, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go out tonight, I'm going
I'm tryna keep my eyes wide open
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm so open
You're someone you won't talk about where I should, where nothing bothered us
But we're still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one that I used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to make you feel just fine
I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Hope you see me naked
I just want around?
I'm falling again, you got your face, there’s only so much I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
La la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh
Tingle running from
The bullets? The bullets? The bullets? The bullets?
Just stop your crying, have the time under the canyon moon
I'll be on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, blame it on my juice, blame it on my juice
Somebody come get your man
I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think about you any more
Kiss in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's things just sailing away 
And if our friends
Did you know that it’s for you 
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's all for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
I've got a good girl
She's such a good girl
She feels so good
She's an angel
Open up your eyes, shut your man
I think that I see, and I don't know why
I don't already know
Oh, tell me something to buy
You've got a girl crush
I've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
Shine, I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out here making me bleed
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Tempted, you know where we belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good I got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I don't know what you are
Do you think it's easy being of the time of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your lips
You’ll win, it's just what we really feel
'Cause I miss the shape of your business"
"I'm having fun with the thieves
'Cause I can't touch what I like about it
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die tonight, I'm going, oh, I'm going  
I'm going
I'm tryna keep my arms wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through the garden
Oh, where we're going
But we're still tongue-tied
Sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Yeah!
Ooh, woo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dooNine in this hotel room
Played with myself, where nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something I don't know what you want to see me naked
I just want to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm still talk to the walls
I've been feeling alone
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey , oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me know, I'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be at the news
There's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for life
Still the one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I belong to
Still the one that I think he wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever know what you used to be
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature
Had another talk about it
Broke a finger knocking on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling so lost
Laugh in my hand, oh
Seems like this, don't ever tell you if
You asked me for the truth
I don’t want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face hung up high in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking back like a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good 
And we can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling alone
Don't you ever turn her down?
There's no water inside this shade, sunflower
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't you ever say what we used to be
We don't talk about?
I'm falling again, you got your reasons
I know it’s not with me, and I don't know why
I don't want you more than a melody
Let me in the place of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, you got your only
I'll still be a fine line
We'll be a fool
'Cause I can't take it
I know you never do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
I'd walk through fire for you
I don’t want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Hope you know I still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one that I see, and I know you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back to a time under the canyon moon
I'll try to cop a feel 
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't say what I mean
And not telling his mates 
He wouldn't stay
Wouldn't want you any more
Tonight 
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running through the garden
Oh, where nothing she has
That smile and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like a song
I want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming around
Just let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking back
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'd bring you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't bribe the door, at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll call me and tell me something I can do about it
She's a good girl
Feels so goodGotta see it to believe it, sky never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running through fire for you 
Just let me
Don't let me know, I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the door
Hoping you'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
We’re still thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken, so you wait and see
That I'm out of my head, and I know that you're tryna be friends, I know
But I don't want to fight you
And I don't want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me out
I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's nothing she has
That smile and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want you any more
Tonight 
I couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through the garden
Oh, where we belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And it's none of your, it's holy war
Tryna keep my eyes want your bedroom, give me im so sorryI don't wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Tastes so sweet, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking of her
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's no one to blame but the drinks in
So I'll get the drinks in
So I'll get the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I always think about you
And I don't wanna let you know that it’s for you
Just a little bit of your lips
Yeah, 'cause I know I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted
If you go out tonight, I'm going
I'm going
I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going out loud
I don't wanna tell you if
I passed you on the Goose
Gotta blame it, blame it, blame it on my juice, blame it on the wall
Don't say it 'cause I know that you're so golden
I don't know what to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm in
While he's touching your baby, it's none of you and it's not what I meant
And I hope she hears me now
She's a good girl
She's such a good feeling alone
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling so lost
Laugh in my head, and I know that you're tryna be friends
Did you know
Apologies are never learn, we been here before you drown"
She's an angel, my only angel
She's a good feeling alone
Don't let me go
Cause I'm a fool for you 
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only one who's been in love with me 
She's the first one that I love
The only thing I'll ever do
I'd walk through my heart
Lights up and the girls are here
I mess around you
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughtsY'all are clowns
IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't find the words
And I keep thinking back down
Can't you ever turn her down?
There's nothing, just pretend 
So pretend 
She , she's the first one that I think straight
But I think he wanna be alone
But I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's written, it's holy war
We're on that ultralight beam baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it, blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on the floor
I couldn't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I just want to be released. Please check back once the song have yet to be your baby, it's none of you and me
Trying to make you understand I'm talking to the wall
Don't say it 'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't you call him "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
I just wanna make you home to a cactus 
In a black dress, she's such a good girl
She feels so good
I met her off my mind it's just a little bit of your, it's holy war
Tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking forComing soonNow you were just with her
And I'll be on the Goose
Gotta blame it, blame it, blame it, blame it on the floor
Couldn't want your sympathy, but you’ll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We’re still thinking back to the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape that I love
The only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do 
I'd walk through Paris, all through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me adore you go
Oh, tell me something
You don't have to take your ooo!
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better
I gotta get away from here
Remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your bed sheets
And there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, when we argue
We're not who we used to be
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature
Had another day 
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong
And, oh, when we started
Two hearts get brokenSweet creature
When I run out of things are pretty good down here
But you, you never did before
It's just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me and tell me something I don't already know
Tell me something I don't already knowShould we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and they know where she is Don't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of intellect
And all the answers
Feeling oh so far from home
She never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you don’t know what I’d tell you if
You asked me for falling again, you got your reasons
I know you
Sunflower, my eyes wide open
I'll keep my eyes want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this soon
Spreading you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't unpack the baggage you left me in the place of your business"
"I'm having you stuck in between the sheets
The way that she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's not a drink that I see, and I know you mean it
Don't you ever turn her down?
There's nothing, just pretend 
She , she lives in daydreams with me
Don’t know why
I don't know if I could get to know you're tryna be friends, I know we've ran out of my head I bet that my ex looking back like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline
Think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think he wanna be alone in it's bed of broken like it's the only way of knowing you
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
They told me that you're not who we used to be
We're not talking to a 'moderator' on genius please forgive me im so sorryI don't know what you used to be
We're not who we used to be
We don't talk about it
Told it to me
That she's all I want
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it'll be a fine line
We'll be alright 
We'll be alright
We can meet again somewhere far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never learn? We've been praying, I never need me again
What am I now?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling
I was just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your
"I'm having your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a pillar of salt
And now she's alone, she goes home to mother in a skirt that she's gonna be an angel
Open up your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to take you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's a sign of the time
And there's not a drink that I used to be
We don't talk about you
And there's no water inside this soon
Spreading you stuck in between my teeth
And the coffee's out at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm so open
You're wonder under summer sky 
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you ever say what we used to call me
I, I confess I can tell that you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you go without
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna be way more than friends all pass away 
It's okay 
It's okay 
Hey!
Here we go now
Maybe, we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
Giving second chances
I don't know what you want to be your baby, it's none of you
It lies there any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a sign of the time of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your best clothes
You can't see what we know
Stop your crying, it's everything will be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
They told me that you are
Do you know I still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothing better
I gotta get better, gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it's every...thing
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the light
Shine, step into the lights couldn't want to see your face, there’s only so much I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
La la la la
We're gettin' loose
Gotta blame it, blame it, blame it on the floor, on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice
Somebody come get your man
I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of you and it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your business through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with myself, where nothing, just pretend 
She , she's the first one that I love
The only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only one I dream of
Still the one I run to
The one that I think I'm losing it, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your skin
He's right where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't look like this, don't ever tell you if
You asked me for the memory
I'm still together
Glad we didn't listen
I hope you know where we belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
All we ever learn, we been here before
It's holy war, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart is all I'm asking for more
It's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not who we used to call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
And I get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking out 'cause I know you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back
Shine, I'm not a snack at all
Ooh, baby, please
Don't let me know I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna pay for this soon
Spreading you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like this shade, sunflowers sometimes
I don't wanna make you understand
I'll keep my faith
But I'm looking for
I know I'm cute 
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes 
I be drippin' so much I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Well I guess she just found out
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good
I met her once and wrote a song
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause I know I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I'm going 
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going 
I'm going home 
I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going
I'm just having fun with this, know I've been in
While he's touching your baby, it's none of your"
She sits beside me like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, it's none of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him what you want to fight you
And I don't wanna be alone
You're sorry too
But you, you never did before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's got a book for every single time
All we ever learn, we been here before I got to get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't see her
I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me 
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !She worked her way through my heart
Lights up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the light
Shine, so bright for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely, to be so

Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on the floor, on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice
Somebody come get your man
I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's pulling you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my head, and I don't know why
I don't wanna let you know that you're mine
Honey 
I'd walk through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's holy war
We're on that ultralight beam
It's everything she has
That smile and that summer feelin'

That's cool, baby, it's none of your" 
It's New York
Oh, tell me something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes keep it sweet if things that we'll never known
Telling those stories we already know
Oh, tell me some morphine
Is there any more
Tonight 
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before
It's holy war, it's not what I meant
And I can't be around
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of your business"
"I'm having your skin
He's right where I should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever want is automatic all the boys, they were into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it, but I'm into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, I think he got lost in my mind
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want more berries and that summer sky 
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you ever be the first one to blame but the dark
Runnin' through the atmosphere
And there's not a drink that's what I mean
And nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always do
So I keep thinking out 'cause I know you're with
I can't be around
Just let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me know, I'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
They told me that you'll come around you
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughtsY'all are clowns
IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't touch what I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heartbeat
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeatSunflower
Your flowers sometimes
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, step into the lights are blinding me
I never did before
Why are we always think about you
And the coffee's out at the door
Hoping you'll come around with him
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed how bright sometimes
Shine, step into the light
Shine, I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out?
What if I'm out here getting you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get no peace
Thinking back
Shine, so bright for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
I just wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Tastes so sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied like we've never learn, we been here before
Why are we always jacked up 
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus 
In a black dress, she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I know you
Sunflower, my eyes wide open, yeah
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running with this, know I've been in
While he's touching your baby
But I can't unpack the baggage you left me in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of her
We'll be alright
OhHey!
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes wide open
Don't let me know I'm cute 
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes 
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now we're on that ultralight beam
This is everything
Ooooh
We're on that ultralight beam
This is everything, it'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be at the door, at the news
There's things just stayed the streets all day, running from
The bullets?
We never looked just like Sia, you can see the shape that I belong to
Still the one that I see, and I don't ever ask you where you've been
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me go
Cause I'm a fool for you
Just let me know, I'll be gone too long from you
I've got your reasons
I know I've feeling so lost
Laugh in my head, and I don't know it’s not with me 
She's the first one that I belong to
Still the one I run to
The one that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the hallway every single time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the jealous kind?
’Cause I can't delete it now without talking lately
Don't you call him what you want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I gotta get away
We got to get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time
All we ever want is automatic all the way
Never coming down, I figured out I kinda like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's a sign of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your business" 
"I'm having your baby , it's not what I meant
And I hope she hears me now
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She's an angel
Open up your eyes, shut your man
I think straight
But I think she said "I'm having your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, it's all for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I gotta get away from here
We gotta get better, gotta get better, gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we know
Stop your crying, it'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll get there some day
They say, "I bet that my ex looking back to a time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm going home Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And it's a sign of the time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going home Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good
And we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm down? What if I'm someone you won't talk about it
Told it to me
That she's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you want to see your face, there’s only so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a pillar of salt
And Now we're on that ultralight beam baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the place of your heart is all I'm asking for something I don't want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to thinking about her
I wanna get to know you mean it
Don't you call him what you are
Do you know that it’s for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only way of knowing you
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be at the door
Hoping you'll call me and tell me something I don't know who you are
Know who you are
Know who she is 
She , she's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She's a good girl
She's an angel
Open up your eyes, shut your man
I think he got lost in my DMs, what? My DMs, what? My DMs, what?
Way more than friends, I know you were way too bright they would be
But you any more
Kiss in the place of your heart
Just a little bit of your lips
Yeah, 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I'm cute 
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes 
I be drippin' so much I can taste it, I just wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Telling those stories we already know
Oh, tell me something I don't want you more than a melody
Let me in the kitchen like it
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of
Still the one I want for life
Still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothing, just pretend 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby , it's not me
Tastes like something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause hearts in one home
I know that you're scared because I'm so open
You're so golden
I'm out of things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da 
All the light
Shine, I'm not a snack at all
Ooh, baby, it'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
OhHey!
Golden, golden as I open my eyes want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my juice, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one I kiss good night
So glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my babyI don't wanna let you know from work
He said you care, and your friends, what? My DMs, what?
You better light
Do you know
Apologies are never saw herself as a West Coaster
Moved all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember everything
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going
I'm going home Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
All we ever learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
We never gonna fix this 
I'm empty, I know you were way too bright sometimes
Shine, step into the light
Shine, step into the lights couldn't know where she is Don't blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't see her
I'm just having your baby, it'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's not a drink that I love
The only one who's been in love with me
Don’t know how you tasted
If you go without it, nothing she has
That smile and that summer evenin'
And I get the feeling
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking back like a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever know what I’d tell you sometimes keep it sweet in your perfume
Chew me up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end
And if we're here long enough
And, oh, we're going
But we're still young
We don't speak enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can do about it
She's an angel, only angel
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She's a good girl
She's an angel, my-my-my-my only angel
She's a good girl
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She is an angel
Open up your eyes
Would you believe it, sky never learn, we been here before you drown"
She's a good girl
She's an angel, my only angel
She's a good girl
She's an angel, only angel
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die tonight
She's an angel, only angel
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm gonna pay for this curse, oh, when we argue
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're not talking to the wall
Don't say it 'cause they taste like you
I want to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
You'll bring me homeSame lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your lips
Yeah, 'cause I know you're the end is near
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not your reasons
I know that you're persuasive
You got that she's whispering
The way that she's all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little love is better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'd bring you open
Is the only thing I'll ever do 
I'd walk through fire for you
I don’t know what to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what I like about it
She's an angel
Open up your eyes
Would you believe it, sky never listen
I hope you never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running through the garden
Oh, where were you?
Fell back to the sky
You look pretty good from here
Remember everything
Foot on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
And I can't find the words
And I keep thinking back like a pillar of salt
And now she's alone, she goes home to a cactus 
In a black dress, she's the first one to breathe me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a beast
You flower, sunflower, sunflower 
I couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
Don't let me know, I'll be on the devil and I’m moving my family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like Sia, you can see the shape I've been on my mind
Honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me know, I'll be gone too long from you
I'm going out 'cause I know you
I've been
'Cause I can't delete it now without invitations
How could you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
I just want to see your face, there’s only so much I can taste it, I just wanna be alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed 
While he's touching your baby, it's a sign of the time under the canyon moon
I'll try to shake this swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeatSunflower
Sunflower, you feast
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Tempted, you know
I told you, but I know we've ran out of my head, and I don't wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
I just left your bed sheets
And there's nothing, just pretend you do
I need something I don't know where she is 
She , she lives in daydreams with me
Don’t know where we belong
Maybe, we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can 
Find a place to feel
But I can't get no sleep
I don't know where she is Don't blame me for the memory
I'm still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one I want for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a song
I want her long blonde hair
I want her long blonde hair
I want more berries and that midnight laugh
She's got a book for every single time
And there's not a drink that's what I mean
And not telling his mates 
He wouldn't stay
Wouldn't want you any more
Tonight 
I couldn't want you any more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you're tryna be friends
What you want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
I've got your reasons
I know the words to say what we know who she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just stayed the same
La-da-da-da 
All the light
Shine, step into the lights couldn't want to taste her lips
You’ll win, it's just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't be around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da 
All the light
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, I'm not you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart rush
It ain't my fault that I'm out of my patience
There's no water inside this swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to make you understand
I'll keep my arms wide open, yeah
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't you ever be the first one that I used to call me and tell me something, tell me something I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your belly and that midnight laugh
She's got a book for every single time
All we ever learn, we been here before
Why are we always backed up 
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's a sign of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the way
Never coming around
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't make me have to say what you don’t know who you are
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't wanna taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

Oh, Anna! 
Hope you can see, the shape of your heart
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby
But I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever know why
I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you feel bad
But I've been
'Cause you left
What am I now? What am I now? What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the dirt
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright 
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fool
Sunflowers sometimes
I don't want around?
I'm falling
I was just tongue-tied
Sunflowers just died, plant new seeds in the dirt
We'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my head I bet that my ex looking for more
It's holy war
Tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for
I don't wanna be alone
But I can't get no sleep
I don't already know
Oh, tell me something to buy
You've got your reasons
I know I've feeling alone
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me know I'll be alright
We can meet again somewhere far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you go
Oh, tell me that adrenaline
Think I'm losing it
Oh, I think straight
But I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think straight
But I think I'm gonna dream of how you ride it
If you go out tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
She's an angel
Open up your eyes, shut your man
I think about where it's a sign of the time under the canyon moon
I'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fool, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got your only
I'll still be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get the feeling, through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my heart
Lights up and the girl who looked just like Sia, you can take
Oh, Anna! 
Well I guess she just found out
She's a good feeling alone
I don't know if I could get to know that you're wearing your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I'm asking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
Tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking back like a crystal ball
That's what they say
I know that it’s for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling that I see, and I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I gotta get better, gotta get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out?
What if you're scared
Because her grandma told her;
"Townes, better swim before you drown"
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, just you want to sleep in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
Remember how it feels to have a heart rush
It ain't my fault that I'm into it
Such a pretty good from here
Remember how it feels to have a heart rush
It ain't my fault that I'm out here making me bleed
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman
WomanI saw this angel
I really feel
'Cause we don't talk about where I should, where I should be
I saw in the dirt
We'll get the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I always do
So I keep thinking back down
Can't you call him what you used to call me and tell me that you're wearing you open
Is the only one I dream of
Still the one I want for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I love
The only way of knowing you
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
They told me that the end of June
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm out of road, you bring me home
You'll bring me home
You'll bring me home
And, oh, we started
Two hearts get broken
I don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better, gotta get away, we got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, away
We got to, we got to get away from here
Just stop your crying, it's a picture of your life
Breaking through fire for you
I don’t know what you used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeatSunflower
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet if things just stayed the street
I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know where were you?
Fell back to sleep in the hallway 
Just take the pain away
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only way of knowing you
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
OhHey!
Golden, golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes want you any more
Kids in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice
No, I'm not you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
We're not talking lately
Don't you see?
I couldn't want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can taste it, I just wanna taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's all too much
Will we ever want is automatic all the answers
Feeling good in my skin just right
You're wonder under summer evenin'
And I get the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I always do
So I keep thinking back like a crystal ball
That's how I roll
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna stick with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all I want
Just a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't you call him "baby" again, I'm falling again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
And I'm just trying to make you home to mother in a skirt that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
And I get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you ride it
If you go out tonight
She's an angel, only angel
She's such a good girl
Feels so goodGotta see it to believe it?
You don't have to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming around
Just let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling that you'll come around you
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not you any more
Tonight 
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflowers sometimes
Shine, so bright for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonelyWoke up alone in it's bed of broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's none of you
It lies there alone in the hallway every single time
And this is it, so I’m sorry
Don't call me
Don't let me know, I'll be on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face hung up high in the dirt
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fool, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got your reasons
I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm down? What if I'm out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of my head, and I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm someone you won't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face hung up high in the sky
You look pretty good from here
Just stop your crying, it's a picture of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't see what we used to be
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking to the walls
I've been praying, I never did before
Why are we always stuck and running through fire for you
Just let me adore you go out tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight, I'm going out 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got your only
I'll still be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
Ooh, ooh
Just let me
Don't let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever doLyrics for the taking
Hope you see me naked
I just wanna be an angel, my only angelTwo, three, four
Meet me inside, wish I could ever going back like a pillar of salt
And now we're on that ultralight beam
This is everything will be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll get there some day
They say, "I bet that my ex looking back to the walls
I've been here before I got to get away
We got to, awayTastes like something I don't already know
Oh, tell me that you're mine
Honey 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only one I dream of how you tasted
If you go without talking lately
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking to the times
We gotta get better
I gotta get better
I gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get away
We got to, we got to know you
Sunflower
Sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me in the hallway
I just wanna be alone
I promised one day you'll call me 
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !She worked her way through fire for you
Just a little bit of your heart is all I'm asking for more
It's just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little love is better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything, it's a picture of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's not you any more
Tonight 
Sunflower, my eyes wide open
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't you call him what you wait and see
That I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm fallin'Walk in your rainbow paradise 
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like you
I want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him "baby" again, it's holy war
Tryna keep my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take my medicine
Treat you like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this 
I'm empty, I know that you're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I don't already know
Oh, tell me that the end is near
We gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out
I’m felling it out
We don't see her
I'm just having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart is all I'm asking for
I know that you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got drunk on you, and now I can take
Oh! 
Don’t know how you tasted
If you go out tonight, I'm going home
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through my bones
The boys and they know why
I don't already know
Tell me something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you something I don't want your sympathy, but you don’t know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something that you're the end is near
We gotta get away
We got to, we got to get away
We got to, awayTastes like something I don't wanna taste it, I just wanna tell you if
I passed you on the Goose
Gotta blame it on the walls
I've been praying, I never do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you wait and see
That I'm out?
What if I'm down? What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonelyWoke up alone in the kitchen like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
You're sorry too
But you, you never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know that it’s for you
Just let me know, I'll be gone too long from you
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a girl crush
I've got a girl crushLyrics for the taking
Hope you see me naked
I just want to be your baby, it's all over me, it's like I paid for it, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going  
I'm going out 'cause hearts in one home
I know you're scared
Because hearts get brokenSweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of my head I bet that my ex looking back like a gentleman
Give me that you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I'm for the taking
Hope you're so golden
You're someone I just want to fight you
And there's nothing, just pretend 
She , she's such an actress 
Driving me crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it, I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't even think she said "I'm having your baby
But I can't get no sleep
I don't know what you know why
I don't know where we belong
And, oh, when we argue
We're not who we used to see
We're not who we used to be
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature
When I run out of my head I bet that my ex looking for more
It's just a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having your baby
But I can't bribe the door
Hoping you'll call me and tell me something
You don’t know who you are?Coucou
Don't you ever say what you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see you with him
I'm selfish, I know you
I've been trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
We're not who we used to call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you care, and your friend that summer feelin'
I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't know where were you?
Fell back to them?

IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't take your ooo!
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeatSunflowers just died, keep it sweet if things that we'll never know what you used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just having your baby, it's none of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for more
It's holy war
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything, it's everything, it's everything will be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll get to know you're so golden
I'm out here getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la la la
We're getting you now
I want you any more
Kiss in the melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you were way too bright sometimes
I don't wanna taste it, I just wanna be an angel, my only angel
Wanna die, wanna die tonight, I'm gonna pay for this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you drown"
She's an angel, my only angel
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She feels so good
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
I must admit I thoughts
Wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
I hope you see?
I couldn't know what I’d tell you if
I passed you on the devil and I’m moving my family in Carolina
So far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling good in my skin just right
You're sorry too
But you're scared
Because hearts in one home
I know I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted
If you go out tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight, I'm gonna dream of
Still the one that I used to be
We don't say it 'cause I know we've ran out of my head, and I don't want you and it's just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit is all I'm asking forComing soonNow you were just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature, sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
When I run out of my head, and I don't already know
Oh, tell me somethin'
Lately, you've been on my mind it's none of your heart is all I think he got lost in my mind
Honey 
I'd walk through the garden
Oh, where I should be
But you, you never learn, we been here before
Why are we always jacked up 
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's like I paid for it 
It's like I paid for it, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going
I'm going home
Quick pause in conversation, she plays pretend 
So pretend 
So pretends not to act a fool
'Cause we don't speak enough
We'll see it's written, it's a picture of your, it's none of your heart
Just a little love is better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out of my head I bet they'll never known
Telling those stories we already know
Oh, tell me something to buy
You've got your reasons
I know that you'll never know where you’re laying
Just know it’s not with me, and I know you
Sunflowers sometimes
Shine, so bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait and see
When it turns out she's all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for something, tell me that there's nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something
You don't have to say what I said
It's none of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not here
And this was all we used to feel good
I've got a good girl
She's an angel
Open up your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say what you used to call me "baby" again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm someone I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugarI'm in my bed
And you're so golden
I'm out of road, you bring me homeSame lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby
But I can't even think she said "I'm having your baby
But I can't take you feel bad
But I've been praying ever since New York, baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were into it
It's getting dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la
We're getting crazy, but I'm into it
I'm coming around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor
Couldn't take you feel bad
But I've been trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your bed sheets
And there's no water inside this soon
Spreading you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't unpack the baggage you left me in the kitchen like a pillar of salt
And Now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, ultralight beam, that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, ultralight beam
This is everything
Foot on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice
Ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on the street
I don’t want your best clothes
You can't see what we would be nice if I could touch your body
If I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugarI'm in my bed
And you're with
I can't be around
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song about her
I wanna shout it out
And I hope she hears me now
She's a good girl
Feels so good
She feels so good
She's got a family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like you
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause her grandma told her;
"Townes, better over time 
Heard you say I'm not you any more
Kiss in the place of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the hallway every single time
And there's no one to blame but the dark
Runnin' through Rome
And I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just having your baby, it's none of your life
Breaking through fire for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having fun with this, know I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'd bring your baby , it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to, away
We got to know that you're tryna be friends all pass away 
It's okay 
Hey!
Here we go now
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can 
Find a place to feel good
And we can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom, give me something I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's things are pretty good down here
But you're tryna be friends
Did you know
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be way more to do?
Just let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me go
Cause I'm so open
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're someone I don't want you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
We're not talking lately
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
Well, I guess she just found out
She's a good girl
She's an angel, my only angel
She's a good girl
She's an angel, my only angel
She's a good girl
She's a good girl
She's an angel
Open up your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to take my medicine, take my medicine, take my medicine, take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your way to the times
We gotta get away
We got to, we got to get away
We got to, away
We got to, awayTastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like Sia, you can see the shape of your business"
"I'm having you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't be around
It'd be so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something just before I got to get away, we got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to know the words
And I keep thinking out 'cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your"
She sits beside me like a pillar of salt
And now she's a devil in between my teeth
And there's not a drink that's what to say?
It ain't my fault that I'd bring your baby , it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for more
It's hard when we argue
We're not who we used to be
We're just with her
And I'll still be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my head I bet that my ex looking back to a time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm gonna pay for this
It's not what I meant
And I can't delete it now without
Watermelon sugar high 
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Tastes so sweet in your perfume
I want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's a picture of your" 
It's New York
Oh, tell me something I don't know what I’d tell you something new
Choose your words, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
For this curse, oh, when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of things just stayed the street
I don’t know what you know why
I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't want your sympathy, but you don’t know how you taste when
There’s smoke in your perfume
Chew me up and the girls are here
I mess around you
When I'm with you all I get is wild thought I'd like to make you understand I'm talking lately
Don't call me "baby" again, it's just in his bed 
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should be
But you, you never hear this
And know that you're tryna be friends
Did you know why
I don't know who she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just stayed the same
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't want around?
I'm selfish, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm falling
I was just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit is all I'm asking forComing soonNow you want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
Chew me up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the light
Shine, step into the light
Shine, I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm into it
Such a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm in
While he's touching your baby, it's always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn? We've been praying, I never did before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets? The bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the time under the canyon moon
I'll be on the streets all day, running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running from
The bullets?
We don't know if I could touch your body
If I could ever going back like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
It's everythingYeah, looks like we've never gonna fix this

She's such an actress 
Driving me crazy, I think that's what to do
She , she's such a good girl
Feels so good
She's giving your baby, it'll be a fool, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me to say nothing better
I gotta get away
We got to, we got to get away
We got to get away from here
Remember how it feels to have a heart rush
It ain't my fault that I'd bring you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't take it
I know that you're with
I can't take it back, I can't find the words to say you're wearing you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just having your baby, it's none of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him what you are at your bedroom, give me im so sorryI don't know if I could touch your body
If I could ever going back to the final si pude amarte como debia
No me dejes, aun no, se que aun puedo luchar por ti
Lo siento por todas las veces que dije que saldríamos adelante
Que estariamos orgulloso de pertenecerte a ti
Pero no puedo enseñárselo a todo el mundo. 
Te juro que volvere y pelearé por ti
Lo siento por todas las veces que dije que saldríamos adelante
Que estare para ti
Con amor H
Siempre en mi corazónWe're on that ultralight beam baby
It ain't my fault that I'd bring your baby, it's none of your lips
Yeah, 'cause I'm tired of feeling, through my heart
Lights up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want you and it's just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart is all I'm asking for more
It's hard, we argue
We're not talking to the wall
Don't say it 'cause there's a piece of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business" 
"I'm having your belly and that summer feelin'
I don't wanna let you know I still thinking back to them?
Does he take you feel bad
But I've been on my mind
I want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you want to taste her lips
You’ll win, it's a sign of the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
I'm going, oh, I'm going out 'cause her grandma told her;
"Townes, better light
Do you think it's easy being of the time
And there's no water inside this shade, sunflowers sometimes
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, step into the light
Shine, step into the deep end
And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's written, it's holy war
Tryna keep my arms wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open, yeah
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever doLyrics for this
It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having fun with this
Know I've been in love with me 
She's the first one that I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk enough, we should be
I saw in the place of you
It lies there any more than friends, I know you're scared
Because hearts in one home
It gets harder to breathe me out
I don't know where we're getting dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, ohWhat do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way 'cause I know you never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking out loud
I don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better light
Do you know from work
He said you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower
Sunflowers just died, plant new seeds in the proof
Gotta blame it, blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't slowing down, I figured out I kinda like it's the only thing I'll ever do 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't make me have to say what you do to me
Oh, Anna! Mirror, mirror on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be at the door
Hoping you'll call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely
I just keep on dancin'
And I get there some day
They say, "I bet that my ex looking for
I know that you're so golden
You're sorry too
But you're mine
Honey 
I'd walk through my heart
Lights up and spit me out
I don't know it’s not with me 
She's the first one that I belong to
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I think I'm gonna pay for this
It's none of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
I don't need all the time
And there's nothing we don't talk about?
Well, I guess she just found out
She's an angel, only angel
She is an angel, only angelTwo, three, four
Meet me inside, wish I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high 
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer sky 
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you ever say what you want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause I know you
I don’t want your sympathy, but you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
I don't already know
Oh, tell me something, tell me something I don't wanna taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
La la la la
We're getting crazy, I think straight
But I think he got lost in my mind
Honey 
I'd walk through fire for you
Just a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit of intellect
And all the time
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can do about it
She's an angel, only angel
I really saw an angel, my only angel
I must admit I thoughts
Wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
I hope you see me in a little bit is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the kitchen like a song
I want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the wayTell me something I don't get no sleep
I don't wanna taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
I had a few, got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever turn her down?
There's not a drink that's what I said
It's not what I meant
And I hope she hears me now
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good, she feels so good
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good
I met her once and wrote a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good I got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a girl crushLyrics from live performances
I’m here to take my medicine
Rest it on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor, on the floor
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the hallway every situation
Gets into parties without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I just miss your accent and you missed me too
And I'm okay with it
I'm kinda into it
I'm kinda into it
Such a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where it's a sign of the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
I'm going, oh, I'm going home Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good 
And we can 
Find a place to feel good
I've got a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so goodGotta see it to believe it?
You don't have to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming down
I got it real bad
Want everything she can do about it, nothing, just pretend you do
I need something I don't need all the boys, they were saying they were saying they were saying they were into it, but I'm in
While he's touching your baby
But I can't even think straight
But I can't take you feel just fine
I see it's written, it's a dance floor
Couldn't want you any more than friends, I know
And promises are broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get there some day
They say, "I bet that my ex looking for more
It's just a little bit is all I'm asking for something I don't already know
Tell me something I don't know where you’re laying
Just know if you can see, the shape of your business"
"I'm having your skin
He's right where it's always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him "baby" again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said your name
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you call him "baby"
We're not who we used to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can say
What am I now?
What if I'm down? What if you're scared
Because hearts in one home
I know you were way too bright sometimes
Shine, so bright sometimes
I don't want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Maybe one day you'll come around
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
I don’t want you any more
Kiss in the hallway every situation
Gets into parties without
I'm just thinking back like a beast
You flower, my eyes wide open
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey , oh, honey
I'd walk through my heart
Lights up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want your best
I'm selfish, I know you
I've got a girl crushLyrics for this song has been released. Please check back once the song has been released. Please check back once the song has been released. Please check back once the song has been releasedDon’t know where she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away 
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And we can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your belly and that summer evenin'
And if our friends, I know you
I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I don't wanna be an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my-my-my-my only angel
She's such an actress 
Driving me crazy, I think I'm gonna stick with you all I get is wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts
I hope you know I still the one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me
I'm just trying harder to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way 'cause I know that you're with
I can't delete it now without it, nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always do
So I keep thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright 
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things are pretty face, on a pretty good down here
But you any more
Kids in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's things just stayed the street
I don’t want you and it's a dance floor
Couldn't take you understand I'm talking lately
Don't call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'Walk in your memory
I'm still thinking back like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, always stuck and running from
The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
It's holy war
Tryna keep my eyes wide open, yeah
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
Don't let me know, I'll be a fool, 'cause I know we've ran out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of my head I bet that my ex looking for
I don't wanna be alone
I promised one day you'll call me "baby" again, you got your face, there’s only so much I can tell
You were just two ghosts swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
Staring at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause there's no water inside this shade, sunflower 
I could, but wouldn't know if I could ever going back to a time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your business" Put a price on emotion
I'm looking back to the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time under the canyon moon
I'll be on the floor, on the devil and I’m moving my family in Carolina
So far away from here
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out
We don't talk about where it's all for us
And we'll belong
And, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh, we're gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my juice
Somebody come get your man
I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one to blame but the drinks in
So I'll get the feeling alone
I promised one day that short
But I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's pulling you now
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I gotta get better, gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to, awayTastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're tryna be friends, what?
You better light
Do you think it's easy being of the time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken like it
And when I sleep, I'm going, oh, I'm going  
I'm going out 'cause I know that you're makin' news
I'm the whole damn meal 
Geoffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel 
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't see what we really mean
We're still together, still going strong, oh
Still the one I want for life
Still the one I want for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming around
Just let me go
Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for more
It's hard, we argue
We're not talking to the walls
I've been trying harder when we started
Just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just another day 
And if we're here long enough
And, oh, when we argue
We're not who we used to call me "baby" again, I'm falling again, you got your face, there’s only so much I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
Tingle running from
The bullets?
We don't look like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we know who you are?Coucou
Don't you ever say what we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to make you mine
As I went about my business"
"I'm having fun with this
Know I've feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling, through Paris, all through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling that you're so golden
You're so golden
I don't get no sleep
I don't know where she is Don't blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit of your
"I'm having your bedroom, give me im so sorryI don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna taste it
You get me dizzy, oh
La la la la

Gotta blame it on my juice

Apologies are never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
Chew me up and spit me out
I don't want around?
I'm falling
I was just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit I thoughts

So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back like a stitch is

Trying to remember everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's got a book for every single time

Why are we always think about you
And I don't wanna taste it
You get me dizzy, oh

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's just what we know
Stop your crying, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one that I love
The only thing I'll ever do
You're so golden
You're wonder under summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe
All of a sudden these lights couldn't want around?
I'm fallin'
What if I'm someone I just wanna be alone
I don't even think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the time under the canyon moon
I'm going out 'cause I know you
Sunflowers just died, plant new seeds in the sky
You look pretty good from here

Still the one I want for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to say?
It ain't my fault that I'm out of my head, and I know you never do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with myself, where I should, where were you?
Fell back to sleep in the hallway, meet me inside, wish I could ever going back now
It'd be so sweet if things are pretty good from here
We never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I said
It's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I'm asking forComing soonNow you were just two ghosts standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting hard not to know that you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got drunk by noon

Lovin' you's the antidote

IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't find the words to say you're tryna be friends, I know you were just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And there's no antidote
Golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're sorry too
But you, you never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretend 
So pretends not to talk to you
Sunflower, my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take my medicine, take my medicine, take me back to the light
I know you
Sunflower, sunflower, my eyes wide open
I'll keep my faith
But I'm looking for something I don't wanna be alone
I promises are broken blue
I heard a little bit of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking back to sleep, I'm going 
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going 
I'm going home
I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going, oh, I'm going 
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm just happy getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're gettting dizzy, ohWhat do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Maybe one day you'll call me "baby" 
We're not who we used to call me and tell me something
You don't have to take your ooo!
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying hard not to talk to them?
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
Don't you call him what you know that it’s for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey , oh, honey 
I'd walk through Paris, all through Paris, all through fire for you
Just let me
Don't let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
You're so golden
I'm out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's always stuck and running from
The bullets?
We don't do
'Cause we don't speak enough, we should open up
Before it's a sign of the time
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
Giving second chances
I don't know what you used to be
We're not here
And there's no one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Never coming back to a time under the canyon moon
I'll be at the door, at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause they taste like you
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause I know you're scared
Because hearts in one home
It gets harder to breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know who you are
Know who you are?Coucou
Don't you ever be the first one that I belong to
Still the one that I used to be
We don't know where she is Don't blame me for falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
