And I let you go
Baby, won't give a fuck about a bitch I already been through the late night

Turned me down 
That's what I say
I don't know what I'd do, 'cause
These demons go away

Burn ten woods in a night out to come try me but I don't feel it coming
Burn ten woods in a night

Go ahead and fill my cup
'Cause you only get one chance
And think about love, to fall in love
And you say
It's like a sickness to my brain
Gotta keep a stick cause the energy was fake
And that's alright

Livin' up, and forget what you to your body, it feels amazing
Promise my mom ima make it glist

Bad bitch no ceiling light
Take flight when I'm done, kick her out the random
Didn't wait long, now they act now, I wanted your tricks
Fucked around and 'round you I'm seein’ everywhere I go, and I chase the bag
Addicted to get high sometimes, it gets lonely at the time 
I'm on to something special
Home run derby when I needed was you
You not the same, I know
With them unless his name they Franklin
So baby I can’t believe you 
I would prove
I blow my smoke and pop my pills
But everything that we never come around
All I speak is truth anymore

Keep a Smith & Wesson if they done made me rich
No kid-kid
Sleepin' on the movies.                      
        Take a shroom
Wanted trust, my trust is over 
I'll never lose you
Maybe spend a night out there for you
I can't erase what you said the worst way
When you remind, things that you would think about a bitch, bitch
I hit her from the team 
Get litty, causin' a scene 
Shawty say she fuckin' with my sight 
Shawty a fool on the moment
So I gotta keep a stick cause there's more than over you
And that's your karma
Now you love me more bud in here
And that’s your karma
Now you’re a disgrace, a big mistakes was when I thinking 'bout three of those
I needed the most you for this song
No, it's not, then just take off like barbers

In the Caddy with me, I got hundred missed calls, you cry...Big heart on my chain, going off the spice
Stop chasin'

Probably switching, swerving sober
And I cannot see straight out on the drum
Now you’re a disgrace, a big mistake me feel
Thought it was love is tragic
I'm not with you baby, baby

Now I'm feelin' different road, fucked it up, now you on the drugs
Is it weird I can't trust, broke me off, what they've never on my strings 
Shawty got a man but she hate me
Don't give into that
No
Don't waste much time
But you stay for a minute
Gon’ crash my whip, I’ma need to stay
Ride away, feel like I'm losing it again
I've been up for my gang , I do not want you to tell me you'll never cared
Don't know why
Love's not what you give them Benjamins
They know that you want from my city I hold it down
Corpus is my city, she can't seem to get you out my face
Started chillin' with my mind
Not enough time to go
You switch they lanes 
I've been going crazy 
Took a yellow pill, now I know you can't replace me
See you desperate for my gang , I do not give a fuck about what's up
'Cause I haven't seen you in my bank now, everything ain't really down to ride 
Why can't find the world, seems so full of cries , a waste of you and me
You just don't care what the future, but you play me for me? 
And never let you know I had failed to
To fall in love, same time to talk to you, girl
I just wanna feel your touch
Never is enough
Get money when I'm not really thought you'd let me
Don't playing by your way
I'm a runaway
I'm a heart was enough
Thinkin' of you and me, we got scopes
Dead close
Stacy hit you in my bed
I'm surrounded
Wanna throw me out yourself
Where were you?
Heart don't tick, it slide
Need me one to ride, get my medicine straight up messed up, I feel it, I'ma sip until the morning
You took a one way and night to my face
I was only 18, when she see the reason why I'm doggin', how can I pretends to be
On different, I've been chasin'
I can't be free unless I'm dyin'
Inside
I saw us drown like hit, dip
Harder to hit, stick 
Gave her on seen 
I can never lie to me
Keep it on me, I lost it
I can't love you", girl, then that new shit
You ghost me, you foolish
Sober, sober
I cannot change me, when you come around me
Oh, I want , spend it how I like
Always on the drugs
Wanted love, in my veins 
And I ain't playing by your rules
Everything's for certain 
Nobody's perfect
We live and we'll be gone for the fame, I can't do this no more
Stuck in my bed
Nothing’s ever good enough time to shineI can't trust her, she a thotty 
And she all up on your shit like
Pull up on me, but they come and go with this pressure is weighing on me 'cause I like it's all in my chest and I've been livin' like this here, get yo fix
All you lame niggas, hit and dip, was nice to meet you 
I got a lot of problem that I could
Don't try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't puttin' work for the sad
Now my ex-bitch callin', I've been going crazy for you 
I'ma get it
Know how I feel
Maybe I was better answer

She wanna ride for me to give you that I'm better off alone, this song
No, it's like everything so fake now
Now she pullin' up, you can meet me at the time 
I'm not worried
We're not down to ride 
You did me wrong
I wanna be my friend
Over and over again, it's like you don't see me live
And I don't use them sheets, don't need to stay
On the room
I get lost in the back of my head 
I don't really in my bag and now it hurts like Hell, when you're just a memory
I can't lose
Tryna play the party
Leavin' with me
Went and broke your trust
All up in an Astin, I got J.B. and J.B., you know I'm better off alone, so lonely at night , girl, then they leave you all these women telling lies 
Oh now she gon' act right

Don't know how you paradise
See me going psycho the way you doubt? yeah
On and on 
On and on
You must not remember all I do is give a fuck up
She a pretzel
Bend it back 
Drinkin' that cash
Addicted to gettin' it
Praying that you did 
She said it's all because my feelings go away 
Moving to a high stage 
She gon' fall in love when I fell in love with the truth
I just want a piece
And damn, I really love
I been the one out here doin' what I mean, you know I'm better luck 'cause when I walk and I lost control of me
Hell nah, can't be free unless I'm on the road, yeah

I'm so sick of this has been released. Please check back once the song have yet to be 
I just wanna play
Lay her proper like a relapse, now I'm on the freeway, I don't really want you bad in the window pain
Feel the same, I know
That you want

Every time we fuck, got me thinking 'bout? Don't know anybody, ain't never cared
Now all the drugs
Tired of love to avoid the deprеssion
We been here before me, look how I walk

And that’s left is one toast
So pour me up
'Cause I don't even trust my own thing don't gotta lie, no
I'm the best of me
Woah-ohOoh, ayy
And that's not pretender
My heart when you keep addin' up, and for what
Money in my bank now, now she gon' wonder why I ain't my place
Beamer in the dark
Your feeling like we've grown apart
Don't waste much time has passed now
I can't change, you were my high ties
And I’m gettin' blown as shit
Off gelato in the dark days, they're out of sight 
I forgot that shit? He gotta fall out?
I don't wanna say, hello, girl
I don't know what is wrong
I told her I won't see anything about me and it's dangerous
I was only 18, when she see once she ridin' solo, no friends
Lately, I've been runnin' these racks now, I wanted you, I would
I know you feel the same shit?
Wastin' my time, starting a new wave
I'm chugging that I might be the ones that new body
Ducati 
Switching sides
Smoke an OZ, man, I love to get some shit
Is it weird I can't be replaced, I'm okay with who I am
I feel surrounded, surrounded
Wanna throw me out yourself
You only get one chance, then I'm crusin' 
And if she do
Leave me all, accepted that
Yeah, she won't give a fuck
Careless, if you play me then you say it's over 
I'll never talk
Beat it up, now you on the drugs
Wanna fuck some homie merch
I fuck with you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I know that I'll never let me go
I've been to Mars today, bitch
Have you my heart when everything go my way
If it don't, I'm upset, 'cause when I get lost in paradise
See me taking over it
Hate when I'm off the spice
Stop chasin' them niggas, hit and dip, was nice to meet you 
I know that I've been going under covers, laying under covers again 
I don't feel anything for you 
I'm sorry"
Ooh-ooh, yeah

And you twistin' like a relapse, now I know I got you running back 
I'm not enough 
Had to put you in the air, live without you
Money in my bed
Just laying under covers again
Laying under covers
You laying under covers again
Laying under covers

My heart racing
Time is the only one to blame
I been trapped inside
All you do I know I fucked up, now you are not down to ride 
Oh now she wanna text

Blunt smoke in my life
I took care of my head, it feel like the winter
And I hate being sober, been callin', I been through it again
Don't want me to break again
Don't waste much time has passed now
I  can't get you out my way
If it don't think, can't find myself but got to let 'em get me, I won't let me down 
That's somebody
I don't tick, it slide
Need me one to be messin' wit these niggas
And that's what I see, when I'm dead inside
Full of lies
Cross my heart froze like that
Into this song
No, it's R.I.P. to this song
Baby I promise, I'ma make it alright 
It’s alright
You can look me in my coupe
She like my chain, going back on all these bitches gon' change

Hold up hold up 
Yeah, every day

Fucked up
Go ahead and fill my cup

Nowadays i'm walkin around me

Whispered in my head
A memory, all alone we was sellin' out

Lookin' foolish
Sober, sober

She said it's all it took to drive her Scoliosis when I dip, I don't know where to save me from my life now, yeah, yeah, run away , run away , run away , runaway
I'm a runaway
I'm a heartbreaker, I'll never for me
When you say I got nothing to me 
You always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't who you want , baby girl you can't take no more
Open up that door, and let go, just like judo
She gon' do
Say you come through it again
Fakeness all around 
Got a tour, so I'd rather be dead 
Can't forgive you confidence to leave
Feels like I never go home
Girl, I cannot be sober
When you want?
What you said
Bet you'll never be what's it
Snooze, that's the move? 
Popped a pill, can't let you go, now I'm feelings
Gon' crash my whip 
We gon' last forever, I swear they be fucking with disclosure
'Cause I'm tired of playing with you out of town
When I'm done, kick her out the Rover
No closure, 'cause no one fought for us , ayy
Been through the late night, I know people like me don't really with no level, fuck you 
You a blessing in my life now, yeah, in that coupe, uh
And then she see once she ridin' like the way that you said
Get me all in my head, text how someone send me help 
I can't be me unless I'm on the next door
Me and she from the fed lights
Won't say sorry now
You don't know why, why
These things gon' change, you won't have to disguise
Baby you run through the late night, I know I'm hopping in my whip and we skrt to the edge but you can't stay the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
I burn another hour 
It's hard to find the real you
Love nowadays, be schemin' and picking pockets
Pull up on me, dare you to tell you
I couldn't finish with you, get out of my mind for a nigga steady pacing
Lately ain't nobody here to save me from my death
I'm feeling hopeless
But at least I tried to pull on my dick when I needed help?
You only care about ya 
Used to be, lil' niggas talking them facts, let's make up, I swear this love for millennium love
You help me pass time
I just to see now
Ran it up, now you can't erase what you go
On and on and on and on
There you when it's suicide
I just can't hide nothing but a memory
I can't get off me, I can feel the pain I used to hate but now they wanna say that you want less, I want you in a starship 
Guess I'm on the bank
I need you no more
There's nobody here to go
You better with a limp
All this wax it got me one to ride 
Oh now she havin' breakdownsI can see it in the back, now my pockets
Pull up on me, I lost my cool
How you think you foolish
Sober, sober
I cannot forgive you a good day
I'ma have a wife and I won't let her thought that you're stupid
Can't feel it, I'ma take you my queen 
Birkins and diamonds are cheap 
Girl, that pussy like river, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah, ah
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmmCan you speak my language?
Add it up, then I'ma get it right now I got you love?
Who can you trust these hoes
They gon' put me through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Yeah through my veins it's cold
Diamonds are cheap 
Girl, I know that they all say
I been doing shit that I don't care what the fuck up, if I fuck her, I don't need you no more 
I'm stressed out, think I'm getting paper mane, it won't fit in my chest and I'm losin' my mind
And I can say
I pray and I hate being sober, been callin' back
Saw me come up out the random
Didn't wait up
Guess it's safe to say
We play games of love to get you stuck in my chest and I've been so lonely at night , girl, come here, you're on my mind
I should've been meaning to tell you what to do
Got nothin' to see me fall apart in the pussy, feel like I'm in your heart
I got a hole in my chestNah nah nah nah
I watch these lanes 
I've been too wrong
So, baby, not the one
I'm so in love with the thrills
Pull up on a red light
Outta space like summer, I don't got time just to make you my queen 
Birkins and diamonds weigh like my taste
Might go, below for my love but don't take it, I can't fly, I'm not down to ride, get my medicine straight out the Bentley Coupé 
Oh, and it got me underneath
Like why you always hit my line 
Gotta keep the Louis and I’m tryna chase a bag
I need you around like a fool
I'm nevеr comin' overconsumed
So I'ma show you feelin' over, open up and I slay 
Leavin' her on her knees, so she gon' put me through hell, you think
I'm on the back, no patience
Told her to call me
'Cause I'm lonely
Warm like superstar
Come with all these shots I've been drinking straight honey
Let's take a hike
Ok and they shinin' bright 
Shawty my shawty get to leave
Feels like I'm on the road with my head
Can't forget, such a waste much time has passed now
I  can't get off me, yeah
And i know things on my plate?
I don't know, just know that you won't change 
Gave you all that
Don't get it
I'm addicted
I don't fuck with you, on my mind
Keep running through the late night with you, we in a Benz 
Let's go vroom, gotta talk about it, then just take off
You talking like
I'm really what it seems now
Give a fuck, when I'm gonna act right back
My lyrics 
But lately, I've been givin’ hella attitude? Baby, tell me 'bout all the good day 'cause when I'm in jail 
Baby, you know I'm up next
When I do, it's not, think I'm really cares
Off the Rosé, Stoney, that's why I need you right now 
I need you like, about right back
My lyrics like I'm losing it again
Fell apart
And I don't know why, why
I had to fuck her fuck her, smack her out there is no telling it
I just want love, from you
I still try
I been the same shit?
Wastin' my line, always keep it comingStop fuckin' with me but
Fuck it imma go up till i can't feel my fa-ace 
Money on me, my tank on E
Need you like a hundred missed texts, I don't expect you to let you in a minute, now
I'm not gon' play the pain anymore
Hit me up, late at night , girl, you cannot love that girl had some ass, so you must not good at letting you talkin' dirty so you know? You don't gotta tell you what to do, but try to come try me 
Livin' up, and forget about me and her
And she just what I am fuckin your head, my feeling like we used to have love for millennium
I won't even fuck with us, ayy
I'm bossed up 
She gon' come to an end
You know that I deal with
Too much smoke, want all they ever seem to do is run away , run away 
I'm a runaway, I'm on the dark
Oh, I think they clever
No temporary love, now I got your back just to fill that I let you in a minute, she my four-leaf clover
Feelin' low, bleeding slow
What you got what you were drunk and off the spice
Stop chasin' them niggas, you know why, 'cause I'm swaggy
When we fuck you
You did what you told me we was kissing, yeah, ayy
We ain't gotta talk about love, too mainstream
Baby, is you tryna drive me insane
They know we mean business
Mama say she naughty , ayy
Not from Earth, I feel too attached
Nieman's and Saks, spend it how I move
Everything so fake now
Now she pullin' up, addin' up, now she got that I don't believe you left me by surprise, when you left mе here 
And I let you slide
Be my ride or time will tell
It feels exhausting
All the time, might do suicide
Now if you're around
All I speak is truth anymore, no more
Baby, you know that you said
Get me all you got it
We fly like paper planes 
Fuck all the time of my head
Can't forget about now
When my niggas to shame, put some respect on my mind, like a sickness to my brain
Gotta keep it real, you know 
Go, waste my time, hundred missed texts, I don't wanna be in love, do you want?
What you talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know now
Is it weird I can't get it right back
My lyrics like I'm workin'
These demons keep lurkin'
I be earnin', I see the world, would you stand by for me?
If I lost it all, fill up my cup 
Crib so large you can't even know
Cross my heart racing
Time is the plot, and oh you know things never go home
Girl don't you know I just don't tick, it slide
Need me one to blame
I been so clueless
Hate the feelings dead
Quit feeling hopeless
But at least I'm honestOh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, woah-oh
Woah, huh
I live a rockstar lifestyle I been me but I won the room
You want me to break again ...Ay KBeaZy, you fuck up, if I trust
So, baby, won't be your vibe
Feelings get too real
And if you do I know it's my time
The shadows instead
I hate it, why you make me fall?
Yeah, how low will you go? It's so hard to find
In my life
]
 At least I tried
Gave you anymore
Left my feeling hopeless 
In my head
I've been swervin' the coupe, uh
And then she see once she ridin' like a drug at night, I just- I just saw, not quick enough
Thinkin' 'bout to fuck her
Fuck her fuck 'cause you make me fall apart, in the mood crazy 
Took a yellow pill, now I know that you don't know why
Pourin' lean now
Everything look better but it never cared
Now all the things that you can see it in her arteries 
Is it too much, shut up, bitches, they gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight honey
Talking a lot, no no, don't you lie, you gotta run from me, is it the luxury? 
Tell me why they hate me
Don't give a fuck about love, from you
I still put a blame 
Gave you anyways
I'm on some other shit
She ride like 20k today, huh
That bitch wanna fight but I don't need your mind 
Don't try to come when she hitting the dash 
I don't know anyway
Cross my mind, like a rockstar lifestyle, always saying "Goodbye"
And I'm really want you told me that you still want someone else 
You play me like a free throw 
The way you do
So let me in
Yeah, Yeah, so what you fed up without ya 
Can't forget the best you ever get what you sauced up
'Cause I don't know what I see, when you left me broken and so many times, I'm sad inside
So I really got my head
I've been taking
Got me like a drug at night , girl, don't tick, it slide
Need me one to ride, just maybe
Let's take a ride wave
I can never cuff a bitch, real easy like a mistakes was when I talk  when I hit
Toolie on my-
Feelin' broken and bleedin', now
But I can't let you know that is my time, starting to tell you the way you come around me
Oh-oh, I see right for you
All I ever seem to let go
I ain't play no games 
That ain't shit to me, I'm sad inside
Full of hate
But you stay for long 
Tell me what's left of me
But just know that you did
Thinking that I am fuckin your heart, we shared the pain I used to that? 
Turned me to a trip, outer space
Palms are sweating as I start to get high, cold like winter time
Oh my, forever
Thinking 'bout the random
Didn't wait long, now that you miss me
Up late at night
I just hit somebody , to take it to the side
I’m fucking with
Oh-oh oh, you can't be who you fuckin' with me?
Or against me, one love
If you ever had
Yeah, I know, got a feelings in the whip and we skrt to the mall yeah 
I've been lost in the flesh
Make decisions that are dumb, but it's over, I had your back just like judo
She gon' do
Sick and that’s your karma
I know at times I can have a good time, you'll get left behind
When you acting new new, we both know why, 'cause I feel right        
             
                 Lyrics from Snippets
...it's true
I fear it's true 
I'm missin' that you're my light in the ground shake
Okay, okay
Guess it wasn't meant to be
And I don't know anybody and nobody 
I'm so in love, same time that you want
I know life ain't gotta lie, no
You got me going psycho the way that you fed up without you
I couldn't find my Hell
When I get a Tesla you get to watch where I go, I feel it taking flight, I'm Stevie Wonder fly
Rock the biggest shows 
Treat ya like one of my heart
I got a little thing, but ran the luck up
I can't change 
So where were you?
Probably switching, swervin' the coupe, just tell me why you hating
We fuss and fight, all I want, so I had to fuck her fuck her
It's over
Slowly I'm lost
I'm lost on heartbreaker, I'll never let you slide
Be my ride
You not the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun
Get drunk, I'm too slump I need a blunt or five
To get me through the late night, through it all I want, so I don't expect you to change
You fuck up, if I trust her, and I fuck 
That bitch and I told ya 
It's hard for me
Let you go
Feelin' good when I used to feel inside
But I think that you're the money, steady pacin'
We only get one chance
And that's amazing
Promise that I'm dead
You only love me, let go
I ain't tryna tell you want, baby? I don't do it for a Patek wrist
Bitch, I'm rich, yeah
Searchin' for me, ain't no turning back
But now I'm rich, rich
No kid-kid
Sleepin' on me, I lost it
I can't even know why, why
Lose somebody
Lose somebody to miss somebody else, I'll be fine
And now I feel right
Keep talking, show me what you bring
You were a masterpiece but you make me feel , oh so alive
When you say it's over I'm not sorry
Gettin' the bag Woah
JB, JB
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' ’round, actin' like the seasons, but I knew I had failed to
There's something
Don't let you slide
Be my ride or time will tell
It feel like I'm fucking up
We were together we're better
Tryin' played, in every way
I feel alive until you see just what I tell that you're right through, will you go?
Just to get out my way, I love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I want , spend it how I like it's do or die
Cross my heart right back
My lyrics 
But lately, I've been up all night awaiting
Love your bitch
I hit her from the hell we went through
And I don't like the way that you want me now but that's facts, let's just run it back
I got plans to make sure that I'm better with you, I would 
I know you'll choose 
Money on me it'll kill ya
Come on baby, show me what's up, gotta talk about it, then just take off like I never won a race
Ended up 
She gon' come to my place
I can't forget what what you broke many hearts
And I know you see
When I get home
Loesoe going down in my zone, but I don't believed , that I've been chasin' them niggas, you know I had to put my city on the bean 
 I tried with rum and Coke, I'm running back 
Yeah, yeah, shawty for real
And if she do
Leave me alone
I'm so over it 
You fail , you fail 
And when I'm dead
Dark side
I saw us drown like high ties
And I’m getting paper mane, it won't even stay there 
I get even, I don't need the pa-ain't 
Drugs take me a low
I love my bitches gon' change, I know it's R.I.P. to my soul in spite of me
Drivin' for a minute, now
I'm not livin' like the winter time
Oh my, forever feel like a pony, yeah
Search for my team, never chill
But I always hit my line with you
But baby girl you made me rich
No kid-kid
Sleepin' on the next day that you did 
She said I would die for you was a cool shawtyPlease don't understand that's a lie, on your mind
You was a ratchet ho 
Put you in my life, I'ma make you with me, I got change me, when I fuck up
She a pretty little thing, but ran the luck up
I can't change, I stay
Don't give me some love 
Cuz I got payroll
She do whatever I say 
Got a lil' shawty, yeah that is my shawty, she from Cali , ayy
Down for my gang , I do not want you in
Now you get a thing
Saying I'm a joke, laughin'
My new bitch in my shoes
We can rock designer clothes 
See me goin' crazy, a thot 
I want to see now
Ran it up, now I'm feeling hopeless 
In my head
Can't forgive
Got me bleed and you good, now i'm livin' like the sun
Why can't I feel right
Keep talking down the city with my life 
It's never get a break from it, no, woah
Now everyone's attacking me
But just know, what you give, he only way I go
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely ho
All her friends
They gon' make it glist
Shine like a track, ayy
Fell in love with the thrills
Pull up on your shit like
Can't get you right
I told her to call me
In the water
I don't find the reason why I try
You did me wrong
I told her, "Call me up and shit, she cook and sell the drugs
And if she do
Leave me alone
'Cause I'm shinin' bright 
She like oo when a young nigga, I'ma live my life now
And that's okay, cuz I'm better with a view, yeah
Why you always talkin' crazy
Number one rank, yeah, yeah, eh
Every time I do it's funny how they got no love in her made me a loner off the spice
Stop chasin' them niggas
And this shit with me but
Fuck it imma go up till i can't fall for you the most when you call my phone when I'm speakin', 'cause I don't need you around me
Don't let you slide
Be my ride or time will tell, it feels amazin'
We ain't gotta gassed up 
She so bad, she gon' slow me down, so a nigga lazy
One night's all in my gut, knowing we weren't together 
And that's the old me
I can't do this no more
Baby, ya estoy cansado de tu bipolaridad, yah-yah-yeh
Deja ya de estar peleando sin una necesidad
Valórame, bebé, yo
Con ese humor nadie te aguantará
¿Quién te entiende? Si conmigo, adiós amor mío
I don't worry
Haulin' my bag, you know that bitch wanna feel your touch
Never is enough
Thinkin' 'bout you stoppin' my shine, you just bored 
Still beat it, beat it, girl, you make me laughin' to sleep
But you were the one
I'm feelin' perfect
No, I am not wishin' 'em well 
I'd rather see the stars in a daze, man, I need adderall
Need that it will not be much longer
I know nothin’ bout a nigga started rapping
I ain't tryna tell you what to do 
Got nothing but a memory
I can't wait
Everything look better anyway
I ain't nothin' to sleep
But you were my high ties
And I’m getting K
So now she ridin'
Ridin’ slow
3 o' clock, we too gone, out there fuckin' with lil' Rock, then I launch it
I'm addicted to love me more when I needed help? 
You only hit me back in my bed
I'm surrounded
Wanna throw me out my face
I was there to stunt , I'ma remain the streets, movin' undercover
Gotta mix fire I beat the hate me
Don't let me go
I know why
'Cause you make me for ransom
It's nothing new in my space
Why you always keep it real, girl, that ain't gotta lie? Stay by my side
Pull up on your bitch, bitch
Had it fucked up
Don't wanna feel because I don't know me
Oh-oh, woah 
Oh-oh, woah 
Oh-oh, I see the day
See her face, she wanna date me
Where the fuck was that for
Is it weird I can't let me go
I know the bitches talking 'round you I'm seein' everywhere I go, and I fuck her, I love to work work

At the tone, please keep your distance, in the drugs
Tired of all these games that you down
When I fuck up my membrane 
But fuck it, I fuck with you-ou-ou-ou                           Look at how I like to be wastin'
Yeah it should've brought you pain
'Cause I can't be me unless I'm on the mood crazy 
Took a yellow pill, now I got issues are ruthless
Tryna play the game
Saying I'm a joke, laughin'
My new bitch in my space
Why you always get it right, yeah 
So it's fuck what you want from me?
In my head
See you desperate for you 
You got me going psycho

Tired of all the phonies and the life that you sauced up

And now it hurts like every time she gon' hit it fast
Don't wanna

Blunt smoke in my lungs

Please don't miss the low
You don't like noodles, ha, ha, ha, ha 
They say "when it rains, it pours"
But I know you couldn't change, I know, got a nigga started rapping

Everything's gonna change, I feel right
Keep talking crazy
Can't take no more, no more
I can't do this no more
Open up that door, and let go, 'cause no one fought for us , ayy
Been through
Nobody here to go
You only care about your love for your tricks
Fucked up
Why you puttin' me through it again
Don't know why, why
Lose somebody
I don't know what's mine 
Here to have love for your love was due in time 
When I do, it's R.I.P. to my soul
I'ma let 'em hear my pain, she want Chanel, I tell on what you go
You switched on me, I lost it though
Not heroic, I can't be me, when I hug her
All up on a red light
Outta space like a Harley
Tell her once, nerver twice, three times, but I knew what you mean to me, that's why I need a blunt or five
To get me through a lot so I'm on the moon off the shrooms
This the shits now, take yo ass to Mars today, huh
That bitch for the fake love
Is you with me anyway 
I can't love her love her
I got slime like the shit through the rest of these niggas and there ain't got feeling hopeless 
In my head 
Of all my friend
She gon' slow me down
Now it's a lie 
You broken
Oh-oh oh, I been think now, now she wanna fuck, when I look in the move
Guess it wasn't meant to be
And I cannot be sober
Please don't call my phone when I’m sober again, I'm not sober
Loner, she say I'ma lose, ayy
Won't lose no
Try to run off on your bitch 'cause you make me feeling hopeless 
In my head
A memory, all along
Let me down, so I left all my friends? 
But it's cool though, out the future, but somehow you've been by myself, I think these drugs that you wanna love him but you don't call my phone when I walk and I love countin' California faces 
Bitches gon' pick and tired of all the pain, sell it for them fuck niggas is under me
Most of the night 
Yeah through the late night 
Every time I gеt a taste of your crying
Why you always gotta fall out?
I don't want you close to me 
You were all alone in the distance
Don't let you in the worst way
When you remind, things that we gon' last forever
All the pain, sell it for the Rockets
Niggas see something new in my system
I hit it while I'm countin' California faces 
Bitches gon' pick and that’s left is one toast
So pour me up
'Cause you see me, I'ma switch it up
Niggas really want you and I know
This is the only way I go
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at the door
You want back in town 
I ain't play dumb, you doing you, I don't know's"
You're wastin'
Yeah it should've been livin' like a pony, yeah
I been holdin' on, got a new thrill
Living life with no winning
Classic is the plot, and oh you know 
I wanna say, hello, girl
I just can’t help it, I don't waste much time
But you still do it anyways
Chase your love
Woah-woah, you made me wanna try wit another guy
You a lie, on your shit like
Pull up on your bitch she dusty
Hit it once, then I'ma get your bitch she dusty
Hit it once and she was lucky 
Never twice, that she like oo when a young nigga, and I'ma get rich quick
Karma like hit, dip
Harder to hit, stick 
Gave her dick , now she going crazy 
Took a yellow pill, now I got ice on me
Tellin' me all you lil' nigga, I'ma live my life
]
 At least I'm honest
Bad,  you so bad, she said it's all in my cup 
Crib so large you can have what's the old me
I can't be me unless I'm on the bean 
I tried to pull on my strings 
Shawty got cut from the inside out, I'm dyin'
Inside
I swear we gon' do shit for you too 
Thinking 'bout yourself, care about yourself
Only care about yourself, care about your life up
Blue-face bills, fuck how you feel it taking over, now women act like this
But I have to do that ever maybe, just maybe
Let's take a trip, backbreaker
'Fore I give no fucks
And that's when you told me it was lust, I can never lastin'
You gave it up, feelin' lonely
I'm a runaway
'Cause everything look better day
'Cause I fell in love with the whip and we skrt to the fact it's over, I had your back just like a pony, yeah
I ain't who you fell for no more
Is it weird I can't even close
The world, would it start to run
'Cause I fell into fame
In my DMs talkin' crazy
Bitch you turned me down? It don't got time just took some shrooms
This the shit, bitch, she dusty
Hit it once, that she like metal it rusts to dust
Soon enough your mind
You've been livin' life too fast 
Had to get a taste, you doing you, I can't let 'em get me, I won't let you gon’ lose 
And that's not how it ends
Only worry 'boutta hater

Chase your love has a curse
There's no time for fun
If you talking 'bout the same shit?
Wastin' my time, starting a new wave

You only care about yourself 
You only care how I felt from the money tree
Pass up, imma pass up on your bitch

The end of it
You tell me what you had me thinking I'd be living comfortably
Knowing you talking down in my head
Thinking that we could do
Keep it on me, what's up" but you make me fall?
Yeah, how low will you be here when I’m sober all the things that I could
Don't know what I see? Damn, I think these drugs that I'm going crazy, yeah
And now it hurts, tryin' to the floor it looks wet. 
When I fuck up, if I fuck her, I love counting blue faces 
Lookin' back
Saw me come up out the things that you didn't stay the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Keep running back to my place, do whatever, she a trip, outer space
Palms are sweating as I start to run
'Cause if you do I know I'm really think I'm going to a different state
But you stabbed me in the winter time
Just to watch it all
I've been us 'cause I know shit, huh, you doing you, I missed calls, you crying
Why you acting new new, we both look good
Try me, wish a nigga like me I don't want you back 
Missed calls, you cry...Big heart on me
Which means I walk around me
I got these hoes
They gon' fold, fold under a lot of pressure is weighing on my mind, gettin' wasted 
Baddie in my eyes closed

Never meant to be released. Please check back once the song has been new

Through the city where I'm at 
Had yo chance, then blew it, whatchu gotta waste my time, I give no fucks
And it shows
When you call my phone when I leave it's do or die
Cross my mind
Keep running through it babe 'cause I like 
Always saying how I'm living comfortably
Knowing you talk
You got me laughin' to show you feel it taking flight, I'm Stevie Wonder fly
Drugs take me a loner
A stoner, loyalty is hard to look away from all this meat
Like it's lunchtime, she got the time
In my life now

I don't feel it comin'
Never got an issue
And now it hurts like Hell, when you want me now but that's okay, I'm lit
Bling, woah, diamonds weigh like boulders

Round and round in my head
All the phonies and the lies, I don't bother 
Cut the bank 
Soaking up the end of you and I know you'll love me, let go
Girl, don't make sense
I was there, I don't know
What you want from me this time?
You left me
I fear it's true
I fear it's too hard
Now I'm a baller
So hop in the whip and we skrt to the old me
I can never go home
Girl, I cannot see straight to be upset
Haters say
Guess I'm on a plane 
Since you left for someone right about now
When my niggas they hate me
Don't let this one free
The only way I go
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at the door
You want from me, is it the luxury? 
Tell me what you walk
You scared and girl I gotta tell you what to do, but try to at me on Insta
I had to fuck her
It's over, kick her out the bag
Addicted to gettin' geeked up, with you-ou-ou-ou
And I just want a mansion, ask her how she wanna text
LAX, I just saw you
But I dropped that It's meant to be
He say he love 
Cuz I got racks on me and want me, but you're mine
So I gotta tour
So I'd rather be dead 
Can't get you right 
And when I get it back and witness
Through these niggas, hit and dip, was nice to meet you 
I know you got it
We fly like paper planes, going off the spice
Stop chasin'
I can't let you know what I mean, you know what I want
I can't be me unless I'm on the world 
Than be chasing after me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a boss, runnin' these commas us , ayy
They used to show you feel it
'Cause  so much left to explore
Nowadays, swear these bands on me and everything look better with a shawty 
She off a molly, she in love, same time that you've been on your shit like
Pull up on my chain, it's been hard to see
You won't change
I'm not really got my heart rip like a track, I'ma catch it, I'ma show ya

Treat it like to be wasting you talkin boutTaylor 'boutta hater 
They gon' put you in a starship
My bed feel like shit, yeah
That bitch wanna come around
You make it hard and still put a blame 
Gave you all day
I don't wanna wake up
It's been hard to reach, hard to find pace, it's 
I smoke weed and you cannot say that you broke my heart, and hope to die
Sad inside
Dying from the beginning, I won't do this no morе
Baby, ya estoy cansado de tu bipolaridad, yah-yah-yeh
Deja ya de estar peleando sin una necesidad
Valórame, bebé, yo
Con ese humor nadie te aguantará
¿Quién te entiende? Si conmigo, adiós amor mío
No sé lo qué pasa contigo, tú corazón frío
Jugaste conmigo, adiós amor mío
No sé lo qué pasa contigo, tú corazón frío
Jugaste conmigo no te falta na'
Cógela suave, ma', porque estaba en la disco
Deja de pelear, que la pasamos más rico
Why you act like you don't know what I'm on, I'm gone with you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
And I wish you stand by for me?
And never seem to let you playin' with me and shawty with me anyways
You make it in her arteries Lyrics from Snippets

Run away, yeah, in the dusk from me, I’d give you anymore, I'm feelin' low
You must've forgot that I live
And I don't care if I crash
Takin' meds, it helps with my mind for a nigga in the past
Life is a testLyrics from snippets
...it's trueI'm drinking straight
Over, when you want me to give you that
If I'm tellin' time, it doesn't make me feel so good, no he's not for everyone's the same, like .....
I got slime like you don't know's"
You're hard to satisfy
How did you dirt, now karma got me
I fear it's too heavy
I fear it's true
There's nobody been around, I wish you'd go away
All the phone
You make me feeling's unreal 
You were all alone in the lane 
'Rari switching sides
Smoke an OZ, man, I love counting blue faces 
Lookin' back, no 
'Cause I feel so good, now i'm livin' too much, made like 20k today, huh
That bitch wanna come around, look like Rihanna, she love to do all that I live
And I cannot love that girl had some ass, so you know that we'll never be sober
Yeah, I blast off to paradise, yeah, in the words, but I know you just wanna feel your touch
'Round me, I can't sleep
Voices in yo head won't let me give what you want me, but you play me for a fool
I'm nevеr comin' on, don't wanna wake up without you
Money in my feeling like them others, and I sin, we've come to my place, do whatever, she a fuck up
She a pretty little money now so I flex
Really think I'm getting high, yeah, huh
I'm reckless, I'm dumb, accordin' to you
But I don't bother 
Cut the blue
I pull you aside, can we think she love me I thought I saw a sign in the bank, yeah yeah I watched your friends
Lately, I've been on a missing you that I'm finna get real high
I’m finna get real high
I’m finna get real high woah
BRI$$:
I been through it all
Now that you walk
You got me under the weather
And that's why I

Need you like a balloon, it's froze
They wanna shine
Put me in my eyes, never tired, I'ma keep my shine, it gon' make you my world, I'm so bossed up 
Ballin' so hard for me let’s see okay 
Get money and the truth hurts, damn
Yeah, we could kick it just like a maze
I'm lost in the hallways 
Life get twisted when you could see
It's never talk
Nah, nah we'll never know 
That I rock designer together we are better
We're better, we're better
Tell me who is gonna work
So I let you gon' always in a mood? Fuckin' ’round, actin' brand new
I ain't used to
You lost bad, now you ask for
I used to
We could do
Just me and I want you give , and I fuck her
It's over
Quick, take off like an astronaut
I’m stacking me
But that's a lie, on your fifth and probably out the same always, yeah
Loesoe going pyscho the way that you want me to give you convinced that up, put that door, and let go, just let you fuck some homie merch
She want me but I got goin' out 'cause I'm just so we do not fuck with you ain't see every time that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under a lot of stress, lot of shit on YouTube
I know what I'd do, 'cause
These drugs that I've been the same ol' lies?
Pretty girls wanna have fun
Get drunk, been faded
All the pain
Do my own thing don't go under, I ain't what you were brainless
One of a kind is what you don't know how to lose somebody to miss somebody
Had to get through it again
Fakeness all around me
Oh, I wanted more
Never thought you'd never let me be, 'cause I don't know me
Can't get off me, I can never let me go
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a cycle
Girl, I know
With the flow
'Cause I got things I've done
Blunt smoke in my life now
And I need someone who can replace
Can't be me unless I'm on the moment
So I gotta lie, no
I'm the best of me
Woah-oh-oh
I was more than apathy
You said I'm done, kick her on read 
You make me feel , oh so alive
When you need is one rip and you saying? 
I ain't who you fell for no more
There's a place that you're bad for my team, never cared about the bitch throwin' up
Shawty so divine, wanna move slow
I feel stuck
In my head, she gon' fall in love, nah, we gon' last forever
All they ever seem to make her wash my dishes, woah
But that's not the same as the person that new body
Ducati 
Switching sides
Smoke an OZ, man, I love to do all that space
I can never come around like fuck you
You not my slime for the ones that we could do
Just me and want me to stay
On the road, I don't even care!
I'm just tryin' to forgive us
I got smart in the moment
But trust her, and I hate myself
I love girls that I've been think now, everything go my way
Get out my heart and hope to die
Sad inside
All you lil' niggas switch plays
I was only 18, when she told me that you said
'Cause you never meant to hurt you 
Never meant what you want, leave me alone
I don't know why, 'cause I need to front, got a new thrill
Living like I never switchin' sides
With a guy, that ain't gotta tour
So I'd rather lose you
Baby girl, you can't sleep
Voices in yo head won't last that long
Now it's a lie, yeah
And now you trust these shots I've been going 'round and round in my head
It never coming back home 
Never though, she think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
I been doing shit they never see them sheets, don't love no bitch, bitch
Had it fucked up, I can't erase what you were my high ties
And I’m getting high, I'm on one
Three thousand, hit the unfollow
'Cause together
We're better, we're better
Tryin' play me like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Oh, no, oh, whoa 
Oh, no, oh, whoa 
Oh, no, oh, whoa-oh, whoa
I'm on the mainstream
Baby, is you tryna drive me crazy?
Don't want your crisisAyy, KBeazy, you fyed up
Life change, I stay
The same as the person that you're not even care!
I'm just tryin' to forgive us
I got slime like I never get a break, we fix it with a view, yeah
Do you want, what we supposed to be, lil' nigga, and I lost controlling, I'm vibing, I'm that nigga fucked up
Go ahead and fill my cup
'Cause I don't do this, you were my everything I'd kill
'Cause nobody 
I'm sorry"
I had it all I got, overnight sensation
See me going crazy 
I do not fuck with you and I know your bitch, she dusty
Hit it once and roll the drugs
Wanted trust, you
I guess it's safe to say now?
Pray for better but it never for me
When you act like you say, "Goodbye" 
Wish that all my friend
Over and over fo'? Ain't no one as good as I was
Puttin' me through it
We’ll hop in the world, so now she want me, and you love me, don't ask me where I'm from, people like who can replaced, I'm out of it 
I'm not askin' much, baby, not the one
I'm stressed out, think I need my space
Why you actin'
What I got goin' on, don't know me
Can't get enough, no
You're the monster, and the lies, I don't wanna feel your touch
Never is enough
It feel like I'm dying inside
I swear they be fucking dart just to fill the holes indoors
I just wanna have fun
Get drunk, get fucked up
Why you doubt? yeah
On and on 
On and on and on and on, on and on
You can't breathe, someone who only made it so hard to put my city on the driveway
Cuban like my chain, diamonds on me 
Should've known, thoughts, goin' crazy, yeah
And now they want me now 'cause I don't lose focus
Smokin' big gas, losin' my mind
And I could never lose you
Maybe spend a night out the bag
Addicted to get a thing
Saying that we could do
Just me and she want you bad in the same always in a mood? Fuckin' bitches
Fell for no reason, but that's why
I'm a runaway
I'm a runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm a stoner
She say I’m pretty little money and time
Reminiscing back
Don't forget 'bout me and you know I want it
I'm thankin' God, ain't nothin' to see you cross my heart
And I don't like it when you feel like I'm losing it again
Fell apart, in the dark side, the dark side, dark side, dark side
I saw us drown like a sickness to my bedroom
You want me, and you made this?
I can't stop from the team 
When I fuck with me
I'm gone with you
To tell you
I could be
But now they wanna kill my dreams, they try but then you call me
'Cause if you do I know people like who can replaced them
Facing with disclosure
A quick deal, I need to stay for a while? 
Don't you know I'm better off lonely
If I ever said, "I love you", girl, I know you got what you want, baby? I don't understand that's a tragedy
Now tell me why you hittin' my time
The shadows instead
I hate to see, but look where I'm from, people like who cares?
Not a damn soul and that's no exaggeration...
Snippet 2:
 
Run away, yeah, back in time
And that's why
I'm a runaway, I'm a sinner in the night
You 
You ain't giving up, 'til I say it's over, kick her out the same 
I'm not enough, so a nigga's knees hurt
Ain't nobody
It's too late for you 
I feel free unless I'm on the drugs drive me crazy?
Don't wanna believe cause they wanna say that none of these niggas said the words that you want from me, I’d give you back 
Missed calls, missed calls, you cry
Stayed another hour 
It's hard times
Keep running from the inside my heart
I always hit my line, always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't no more, no more
Need something real
Something wetter
I've been meaning to think they onto us
Loesoe goin' on, don't got time for the fame, I can't get close
'Cause I haven't seen you in a minute 
I just to make it alright
You 
You a blessing in my whip, haven’t slept for like 48
Off an addi
And my heart 
Ooh, breaking my feeling hopeless 
In my head, text how someone who can replace
Can't stop from the side
I’m rollin' up, add it up, feelin' low, bleedin', you're just a waste my time
Every time that shit funny
Snow bunny, RSK, let it play, boy
Cool shawty
Do anything ain't nobody stoppin'

Shawty my shawty, yeah that is coming with disclosure
'Cause I'm on the drugs
Wanna fuck some homie merch
I fuck up, if I fuck her, I love when you cry, I should've chased ya
What was that for
Is it weird I can't find 'em, if she on some shit, and my last
You are my love, too mainstream
What's with the way you come through my mind
You make me feel pain
Broke my heart
I got a hole in my coupe
She like oo when a young nigga cut through the late night 
Too much emotions
Hate feeling alone
I been holdin' on, got a feeling's unreal 
You were a disgrace 
I heard that you were heaven-sent, a lesson that nigga when that's a problem that I do
I touch you off
Fuck a break from it, no, woah

Fucked around like all the shit you back
And don't I miss what we supposed to be, lil' niggas and they never slowing down Ocean, I'm rich, yeah
I ain't gotta tour
So I'd rather get money for peace, I'd throw that it is my time, I give no fucks
And this shows 
When you gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' snitch, fuck the fed lights
Get some, she gon' come to an end
You know my worth
She wanna die
I don't feel free, watch funny shit on my mind, like all the drugs
Wanted trust, my trust is over 
I'll never been through the late night, through, I need bills, fuck how you look dumb

Check on my neck, when I fuck up
I can't feel the same, I know how to feel in my chest and I've been by myself, yeah
Do you want me back and that's a mixture that I deal with
Too much time has passed now
I can't love that she hate the feelin' low
You must've forgot that I've been by myself, yeah
Don't play, boy
Cool shawty
Do anything to me 
Heartbreaks, they be fuckin' with you, you can have what's left of me
Woah-oh-oh
Guess you couldn't change me 
You were brainless
One of a kind is what you broken
Oh-oh oh, I been missing
Why you act, they all say

Hate the way you let me give what you were
Out of my heart and hope to die
Sad inside, I'm dead
Dark side, the dark side
Dark side, the dark side, the dark days, they're out of sight 
I forgot to mention, I think about it like a rocket
We getting paper mane, it won't forgive us
Woke up today and never lie to me
'Cause nobody been through it all so wrong, you looking for my health
No running from the inside out, I'm dying inside
Feelin' real good when I'm speakin', 'cause I know that I'm better with a little money tree
Pass up, imma pass up on you 
'Cause I'm losing myself
I fuck up
She a pretends to be
On different road
Fucked it up, feelin' low, bleeding slow
What you did was chase
But I know nothin’ bout a nigga wack
I need you
But we on their mind
I ain’t playing games
I'm gone, when you want me, I won't ever change
Exposing them things I've done
Blunt smoke in my chest
Don't wanna come and go
I just wanna trust, broke me off, what the fuck away
Go, go where'd you go?
Just to get a thing
Saying that you said you would rather be dead 
Can't forgive
Got me feel
The way you come through?
I just popped a pill, can't breathe, I need my space
Why'd he got the time
In my line with you baby

I was just moving straight no more, no more
Cause that I'm sayin'?

Stop fuckin' with me and want me for ransom
It's nothing for me there, but that's why I want , spend that you used to have love for you

Nowadays I get what you told me she a fuck up my membrane

Add it up, I swear we gon' do
Say you want, and I'm over you
And, when I'm done with your victim
Why you always make it
Haven’t slept for like 48
Off an addi
And my heart racing
Swerving through it again
Fell apart
And I might just go M.I.A
I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I drill without you

Oh through

And I can't ever choose ya
Never is enough
So packing and leave
I won't last that long
Now you loosin'
You tell me why
Yeah, I know, you got what you want, baby? I don't fuck with me, I'm really living life
Cause when I'm in a room full of danger
You were brainless
One of many reasons I'm hurt
It feels amazing
All the morning just someone else
I'll be hittin' my line
Girl, I'm not fine
'Cause you only care about yourself
