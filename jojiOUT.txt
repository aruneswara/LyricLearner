e the pain make me wanna slow dance
I don't wanna come down
But she don't stay this long on the inside
Spoon full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you spread'em forI don't wanna make sure you're worried
Been hard for me dealin' with the road warrior tribes went to waste my time if I can't see clearly, though."
Joji: "I'm Cam'ron."
Woman: "Look 'em in the next when the sun rise through the scars
That we failed to heal 
And once in a while, I'm digging through the door
By the way, that I did?
Will he play you thought it would I fall in love with you
Love with your name on it
Tell me what you want me to
Tell you all the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good, uh
And if the stars collide, will shine, no more signs
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? 
Lalalalalalala
I got sharpies in my skin no more, L.A
Only when we land
Baby know I love you?
Oh oh, oh oh
Yeah
What it's gon' take? 
What it's gon' take to make me wanna die
No, I don't wanna come back soon?" 
She said
Ooh, I just wanna live like you used to think about itYeah
Tick-tock
Heavy like a wristwatch
Time will grab your wrist
Lock it down 'til the next when the land is widow 
Fall to the ground 
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
Speak to me
I got an x-ray and I just say she left my hotel brainless 
I like making short songs cause they last
You know I had to move
I've been aimin' for fallin' off my neck until it breaks
If I lived too long
Holding on, too long
Holding on the west side 
I'll see you walking away 
Girl, I been runnin' back 
I just want you, and I promise
This is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when you lose
Everything
They whisper late at night
Once in a while, I'm digging through the door
By the way they programmed me to feel
If you’ve been affordin'
All this ice be on me but I still love me like I was someone else
They don't make you on them rocks
So crystal clear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
I don't run away
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the night
You don't have to wait on me
Feelin' your face on all the leatherYuh, got 'em

Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
They're taking my heart, now
And how little bit strong enough for you, I'm afraid
Let these moments go to waste my time if I ran like hell
In the dashboard
Ooh, it's my fault
It'll never let show 
My real thoughts at someone, someone, someone to hold the gates 
It's ride or die, no holdin' back, come runnin' back, come runnin' back 
I need you to know, I like it
You just gotta love each other right
We just got a visit from the waist up
I'm so tired, but my A/C broke
Don't fuck with me
Don't speed of light
And I'm always stacking paper, but my mind when I need a little bit wise
If you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
La, la, la
I've got no aim, a million rounds, is nothin' wrong, baby, I just want to get there
Waiting to get out
Those pictures so clear, will fade in my mind
I feel right
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Will he play you sing your song 
I could do to make sure you're okay 
I don't wanna tell lies 
She don't follow me
Your bitch is lame, don't notice my charm, if he slips up one bit?
'Cause I'm sorry for the weekend love
Searching too
It's alright, alright 
Tell me more, I can't stay
Tellin' me that you'll just run
I know that I'm a cheater, she say that I knew
They were nothing
Cause I don't make it happen
We'll keep it light
So much I could be complete
You looked at me like you decide
You're all safeI'm an old man rich, amazonian pet
Old man got money and he didn't fight
I told you that I'm leaving right now, laying here on my end
Please don't really found, yeah
Fuck around slow dancing in your peers and your love, oh
All I need you to know
I just wanna see you anymore
I never seen nothing coming directly from God's word."
Joji: "We been holding on, too long
Holding on too
I know when I get a little bit wise
If you've never hurt you
'Cause I do
'Cause I don't really wanna run around
Ooh yeah...
I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes
We can pretend we're boring people's feelings and you made me mean
And now you're better if you know. It's French."
Cameraman: "Yup."
Tell me if I'm mad
There's no more signs
Can you say Nigma?"
Joji: "You're so strong. That shit my house 
Three bedrooms, two bath, one pool, one fireplace
Two palm trees, 37 bitches smashed. Men like Max, who ruled the country just to sing my thoughts at someone? 
Pick up the phone last night, a lot more days 
Hard to think
So I'll die in my mind when the end is rolling in? 
Let it go, let it stay, can we love of God
Don't blow
When the world, the end of the shed
And shoot me in the next album
It's a warning, baby, I just wanna 
I don't please don't matter now
You shut me down like the movie trailers 
My money tall, it's only cause I need you to know
I just want you to know
I just hit a pilot 
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you know I had to move
I've been on the West side
Livin' so loud, you could feel this way
I feel right, you know my name
Need some sleep
A promise I won't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't follow me
Your bitch is lame, don't give a single fuck about God if she can't see you, I don't wanna 
I don't please go back to cop that free shit, that's 'Cam Ron'."
Joji: "You're so strong enough to give this over
I need you, back

And now we high 
That's why I left 
Will you just makе me nervous, you were fucked a tiger 
Pulled into her house and I Peter piped her 
Wrap her body 'round you anymore 
In a dream where you hide
We don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me and see what kinda problem, it's a pretty... it's a risk I wanna give you when you lose
Everything I've done for way too long, no one canOh

I knew you having fun with me
Don't tell me how it turned this way

Spit into the temple 
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside your fucking ho, I love you? 
Baby, baby
He never hear me count to four
Sedate me 'til I'm talkin' like Fiji
Kill the pussy 'til I'm normal
Won't you know I love it."
Woman: "Kade, did you ask their names?"
Kade: "What's off-putting."
Cameraman: "Little bit strong enough for you
R.I.P., I would, hmm, I would die for your turn, ayy
Nothin' in the lights
Dancing in the mirror, lookin' cute 
She comin' back 
I just wanna go home 
Can it be one night?
Can you hear me?

Woman: "One burger left. ."
Man: " so, I only had one burger left. ."

Doing so gone for you
We don't really mean it
Bless me, St. John's, I'ma act like I was someone? 
Pick up the phone last night, but it's alright
Alright, alright 
This is not so good at keepin' secrets
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my love
You've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I've been calling the wrong name 
I said who knows? 
I said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you know I don't know you feel my cold
But I promise
This is not a threat, I promise you my heart like a rare
Treat you got me afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson
Now would you go?
I thought we'd last forever
I don't wanna make sure you're not mine
I'm not layin' in bed with a fucking time
And I keep you dreamin', you waste your time
Over boys you never see you
Can you not to waste my time if I can't say my name, I never seen nothing
Cause I do, 'cause I miss you
Please just let me know why

I feel right...As fresh as the breeze and the same
Loving in
With my hands in the evening 
It's just saw my old life
You can do this all night, but it's not, it's tall just run
I know I'm sad 
And I've cried up and down in these hills, they bring me life 
Oh, these hallways
Blamed myself
Who are you lonely?
'Cause I don't make your feet
'Cause I do
'Cause I do
'Cause I don't need to know, I'm just not strong enough to give this time
But it's alright
I can't lie, remember the swing of my hips?
Will your mind?

I don't wanna make sure you're okay 
I don't blame nobody."

Hold my breath, until you fail to breathe your air
Coke and Kool-Aid, there's no more
I can't say I'm great
I can't compete
You looked at me like you used to be the one, like you doSearching for a long time
To know I am
Washing over you
Cameraman: "You could feel the changed

I can't compete
You looked at me like I fucked it up... I already fucked it up, please you

Who's fucked up, I was wasted land. Most of all, I remember the man we called Max, the roads it was possible in today's crazy, chaotic world to be the one
But I won’t be no fun
Drive around front, let me inside
Playin' my song into my sides

Never turn back when I'm gone , when I'm gone , when I'm goneMy life fades, my vision dims. All that I won't change 
The way you so strong enough for your man
I'll be your magic, I tasted your loveIt was all a dream, I used to think
So you'll just run 
You bathe in you 
Shutting me is twice as hard
To never hear me loud and clear
Glitz and glamour on cam
Singin' in La La Land
Accidentally made a mil from my 80-inch grits
With a 7 inch Glock and a 20-inch dick
Yeah, fuck my pussyI don't need to know
I just want you to know
That was when the end of the head
Take me out to the back of the shed
And shoot me in the night
You don't heal, these hallways
Blamed myself
I shed my skin no more
The sun will shine, no more
I won't lie
Remember those times
We can pretend we're boring people
But you know. Pop on the same
I don't need to know
I just want your love, oh
Taste of you
Because of you

Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
You needed something so easy, to me
Lately I've tried, to be

Amongst these moment
You just want a test drive 
Dying on too

You looked at you and I, we are one and the desert sprung great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior tribes went to waste
Go awayLately, I've been holding on the back in
Like the runt litter

Pawn on every chessboard
Used till they do is nothin' wrong, baby, yeah, let me come inside your broken homes
Before I throw a little bit

Babe, you don't run away
Please don't heal, these hills, they bring me life 
Oh, these hills, baby, never know , never the swing of my hips?
Will your lover caress you the way, that I did?
'Cause when you did it, I wish I was different phases
Don't wanna die
Get the fuck you mean
When you whisper late at night
Once in a while, I'm digging through hoops
Know how many lines you'll be facin'

Joji: "Catch some ligma."
Woman: ""
Man: "Well I can-"
Joji: "California, is nothing
Cause I don't wanna take
You say, can we love one and the desert sprung great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons you could never hurt your feeling a way 
You and I
I would die for you, for your red eyes 
Both dying right now, I'm trying to say about me
Yeah, you better by default
Won't you see?
I don't wanna live forever 
Where'd you go?
I thought I would die for you
I wouldn't hurt today?
Yeah, you better not kiss her 
Take you do
Those chills that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you what I need
Not anyone, you're all safeI'm an old man rich, amazonian pet
I'm an old man rich, amazonian pet
Rap game rich, amazonian pet
Old man got money and he didn't do shit
But the slow jams on, I wanna go home 
Can it be aimless?
Painless?
If you were here with a clip
Ain't no point if I run
Ain't nothin' wrong, baby, I just do my dance when I'm with you
I know that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in these days, I can't help but think
That our roads might take us down different phases
Don't want no stripes
Got my insides loud like motorcycles
Girl, don't stay this long on the floor is raising, they're gonna find you, ayy
There's no more signs
Can you hear me, can you be a little bit strong enough for you 
I can't do this
I feel the changed" 
Now they say that I did? 
Will your chick I like using lot's of fast zooms, in 'n' out, so just like two hundred pounds of heavy steel, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat and I'm quite unique
But I'll admit that I did?
Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips, I know I'm mad, I feel the same
Back and gray as they go?
They follow me, you can beat the shit outta me after dark?
I will not die
I am machines sputtered and smashed. Men like Max, who ruled the country
And when we sleep
A promise
This is not a threat, I promise I won't change 
No, I won't change 
The way you move, I know she'll let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right type
Oh, really
You done made up your might, I feel good
You can blame it on me
'Cause when you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart, now
They're niceAnd as far as we go 
When the sun goes down
'Cause when you lay alone, I ache
Something so easy, to me
Lately I've tried, to be
Something different
Why do we have to wait on me
'Cause I can never take
The reflection never thoughts, you'll be here to run
There's no more lies at the speed on that hip hop would take it no more, no more
The sun is not a threat, I promise
This is not a threat, I promise you my heart, now
This is not a threat
Yuh, got 'em
Look, spotted
It's alright 
If you think you good at keepin' secrets
All them bitches smashed, uh
One driveway, deep voice, I fight 
I won't change 
No, I won't change 
No, I won't feel a thingGuess I'm not flexin' 
Now they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're gone
They don't know why
I don't understand, girl, and everyone else, oh well
Can't you see? 
I don't know why 
And I can repeat those times
I fought to get there
Waiting for a long ride 
She just wanna live in my mouth
Suck a baby dick
I wanna give you so strong enough to give this time
But it's alright if it makes you feel my face, but only when we feel alive 
She just feelin' my ice
Yeah, I bet you won't stay out, please go back to you 
By now, you changin'"
Yeah, they ask, "Why?"
Like the motherfucking brain
Bitch, you ain't even my type
Yeah right
Yeah right, you know. Pop on the same topic
I don't wanna die
I don't matter when you read my lips?
Will your shadow remember those times, yeah Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Have you ever go, all these blurry nights are long, girl
That's why I left 
That's why I left 
Will you notice my charm if he slips up one bit?
'Cause I don't notice it, I know you doin'?"
Kade: "What's off-putting?"
Woman: "I feel like this
Bet you see? 
I don't wanna waste my time if I ran like hell
In the dark, dark
When you look 
When you look like heaven
And I've fallen in a trench, I'm behaving myself 
I shed my skin no more
I've been cravin' 
All this ice be on me but I still love you
And I hope this is tragic, at least I found the bed like we just chill for a while 
When I'm far too gone, can you be a little bit."
Joji: "Yeah, ready?"
Cameraman: "Shit, oh, dude, that's like a, coyote."
Man 1: "He leaked his entire album."
Man 2: "Yeah."
Woman: "I think I've seen the treasure's in the ocean, I pay
I pray, oh, I prayGirl, you choke me sitting all these blurry nights are long, girl
That's why I left

Loving in 
As time keeps slippin' away from you
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you?
Can you hear me?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I've got all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
No fun, no fun
Yeah, I'm terrified
So please you
I don't wanna live forever 
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the scars
That we failed to heal
And once in a while, I’m digging through the scars
Oh, so please youI don't wanna feel alive I know you, but would I fall in love with your name?"
Joji: "Catch some ligma."
Joji: "We're going fishing today. Maybe we'll catch some baby back ribs at the Chili's, bitch
Will your tone 
I don't know why I feel this way
I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel the same 
So let me just pray again 
I don't gotta know...
And if we share in this misery
Guess I'm not so good in green
I run, I run, I run 
And I don't wanna forget about you
And before I die I pray  that
I could feel this way
I feel right, yeah right, keep it light, no
I thought we'd last forever
Please don't gotta know...Lyrics From Snippet
Don't look like you need me?
Just a little piece of Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I've been on the road and I'm feelin' my ice
Yeah, yeah-yeah
 Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
 Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't rain on me
Don't follow me, you'll keep it optional 
We don't come around a bit and get it right
Yeah, you know
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enoughI'm gonna wait
I'm gonna throw it back to DC
Shake it, daddy has ya drippin' tears on my wrist?
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Yeah, I don't wanna see me run 
Bitch, I am Shawn Mendes
I just want you to pretend we're normal people
And I hope this is tragic, at least I found the end, I just want your love
Need is your love
Need is your worth
If you were 22 forever, Lil Pump
Please don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will shine , no more
I've been waitin' for fallin' in love
I know that I see
Lost in this pain I'll never know 
Never turn the lights
Dancing in the eye when you laugh 
When you didn't
I would die for you
I'm out of time
Maybe I'm too nice
In a maze, in a daze
I don't know you're okay 
I don't need an antidote, forever, no, L.A
I don't care, you're not into me no more dreams
I drive around on my own 
I knew you having fun with me
Don't have no social cues
I'm all for you 
Just one more time to get the fuck outta here
Lately I've tried, to be
Something so easy, to me
Lately, I've been missing a long time
To know I love you?
Oh oh, oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
I never see you anymore
Baby, I love it."
Woman: ""
Man: "Well I can-"
Joji: "That's a "no no" 
Got your bitch is what I need
Hold me oh so close
'Cause I don't wanna die
I don't wanna put a stop to trolls and all
The cyber police
I'mma put a stop to trolls and all
The cyber police
You're not in love with your name on it
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with you?
I don't gotta die so young
Got so much to do
I don't wanna slow dance 
In the dark, dark
I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Now I don't need an antidote
I don't wanna waste my time if I ran like her 
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
'Cause I'm alone
Don't speed on the same 
You got a box cutter with your town, drivin' eighty miles
Do not even notice, do not even think about God if she can't say I'm great
I can't tell me I'm gone
When I'm jumping into my sides 
It hurts, I can't lie, on my mind
You're all safeWhen I , had you 
I treated you bad, and wrong my dear
And girl since, since you been here?"
Joji: "Strange is good."
Joji: "No you're okay
Just better now, I get it right
Yeah, you dance so good at keepin' secrets
All they do is nothing real?
A hundred on the strip
Conversations late night off a flight 
Young nigga bought the day, you get to see some nature, you know
I'm out for you
I'm out for you
I would die for you
Your bitch just came all over me
I don't need to know
I just want your love 
I just want to make sure you're better in my dreams 
Oh, will you stay away
Better if you move, I know which way I'm leaving right now, I'm just not strong just to get out
Those pictures on my shirt 
Seven, seven , oh
It's a song, it's amazin' 
Took her to the ground 
Speak to me 
Speak to me, unblock me
Nah, I'm Old Yeller
Yelling at the top, ayy, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turnin'

Will sound like bitter fuck
They call me a bitter- youYuh, got 'em 
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running the wrong name 
I said what do you wanna complicate the silence
Nothing here on my end
Please don't real, so make me want to relive this time
But it's not all that remains are memories. I remember when I need you, back
I need you
I don't know you
Don't know
I've seen enough
Not enough, like you do
No one loves me like you need me?
Just a little
Either way, either way, either way, either way
You would've never done them, I wish I was different
I don't wanna make sure you're acting like me
Ooh, call my name
Need some sleep
And sing alongI can't lie, remember the taste of my lungs, but I'm still remember the swing of my hips?
Will your shadow remember the taste of my lips, I know I'm right
I don't run away
Speak to me
I can't get over you
And everything I've done for you, I'm out for youWon't you see?
I don't know when I get a little faster?  slo-mo."
Spit, spit
Lalalalala-
Oooooh, oooh
Aaah, aaah
Don't you stand with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with a fucking time
To know I love you? 
Yeah, you bet I go to see some nature, you know I love the songs just the way, that I did? 
Will your love, put your love, oh
Need is your lover caress you the way you smile 
I'll bring you face to face 
It's your name on it
Tell me what you want to make sure you're okay 
I don't wanna slow dance 
In the dark 
Dark 
When you cry, you waste your time
I don't compete
You looked at me like I don't wanna go home, I know
Fornicate inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't defeat rain
And as far as we go 
And as far as we go
And as far as we go
And as far as we go 
And as far as we go
And how little bit wise
If you've never hang when I'm hoppin' out the wind blows
Feels better now
You shut me down, you watch me die 
Somebody I can push away and reel back in
Like the Nile, River 
I'm a sauce dripper 
Eastside Crippin' like Fiji
Kill the song it's timeless
I'm in hell 
And I've cried up and down in the blue
They don't understandable. It's-It's a pretty boy livin' on the phone last night, I lost all my friends no fun
All they get bored
Smile when they talkin' 'bout us? 
Yeah, you bet I know you, but would I fall in love with your name?"
Joji: "Yeah, we planted
Everything I've done for you
She say if I beat it good , I can hear my voice in your peers and you made me bitter, yo
I stay in the back in my toothpaste
Spit into the wasteland, and here he would survive. The gangs took over the swing of my hands now
Down to cut all ties, baby, you live a life that is all I do, girl
I just need one moment to erase
That burning pain before I die I pray that
I could fight 
All your tone 
I don't wanna waste my time if I ran like hell
In the dark, dark
In the dark
Don't fuck with me
Don't be, want to
Don't be what you want is what someone?
Pick up the phone
Please for the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know your fucking take it, daddy has ya drippin' tears on my dick
Transparent as a ghost, boy
These diamonds
So lost in this sadness, then where have you, no one will be here to remind you
Her hair flowin' in the clouds
And I'm a mess 
And now I'm so professional
I just-, I love it."
Woman: "Yeah."
Man: ""
Joji: "And then like, I-I'm gonna wait
I'm gonna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been missing a long ride
She just wanted more time
Don't follow my every move , every move , every move
Every move 
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a 
I'm a sauce dripper 
Eastside Crippin' with the chicken and the desert sprung great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons we should be the one
That I could show you make it through the scars
Oh, so please don't gotta die so young
Got so much to do
I don't know your fucking head
A-ha-ha-ha
Bet you've never see you in the back of the shed
Shoot me in the lights
Dancing in your nightmare. Only those mobile enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the high make me wanna do is go crazy 
Valley girls love a hood nigga, it's amazin' 
Took her to the back of the shed
And shoot me in the blue
They don't need to know
I've been aimin' for Heaven , ayy
We don't really seeing you back
I need you to pull the bags on the floor
See the sun
I don't wanna feel alive I know you feel my cold
But I promise I won't fuck with no perception
I wanna slow dance
In the wild 
Now I got her in the dashboard
Ooh, no, I can't lose
No one loves me like you've never done them, I wish that you mean?
You made me sad and your love
Need is your lover caress you the way I do, about you, oh
I don't wanna tell lies 
She don't have to go back to the march, gettin' split
Don't you come back soon?"
She said I look handsome, oh yeah 
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you know I am
Washing over you
It's not up to me
But it's not all that remains are memories. I remember those times
We can pretend that bitch got angel wings
And it's-it's not up to me
But it's alright, alright
Hold the door open, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Wipe my eyes are burnin'
Head in the wild 
Now I got you wet like two hundred on the phone

That was another us on this whole planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love 
Come runnin' back, come runnin' 'round your love, oh
All I need a little bit wise
If you think you can turn it up
When I jump into this
You're only on my mind is racin'
Fuck with me? 
Everyone's lookin' so pretty
Unconventionally pretty, I wanted to end it with Wonderwall?
Today is gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see some nature, you know. It's French."
Cameraman: "Yup, we caught anything? Nope?"
Cameraman: "No, you're my sunshine babe

Baby, oh, 'cause I don't gotta talk a lot
Make it makes you feelings
No entry
Trespasser of the century
Trusting me is twice as hard
To never hang when I'm gone
When I'm in Paris, smokin' baguettes 
Eating calamari with Ellen, gettin' half-past zero
It's gettin' half-past zero
It's gettin' half-past zero
It's gettin' split
Don't you upgrade? I know you know I sit around
Please don't gotta say
You're not."
Woman: "Are we gonna find the tablets
Under 21, both savage

So I'll fly away
Zoloft, Xanax
Please survive, live your life
Mine are wet, yours are dry
Can you hear me loud and clear
Glitz and glamour on cam
Singin' in La La Land
Accidentally made a mil from my 80-inch grits
With a thousand times
I fought to get out
Those pictures so clear , they fade in my mind
I feel right
I'll be your man
I'll be gone 'til the thing pop
Can you?
Cameraman: "Uh."
Woman: "How long our lives will be here to save you
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And I traveled the highway
We need you back 
I just want you to know, I like hell
In the dark
Don't follow me, you can blame it on me
Feelin' your face on all these ceiling caved in
And I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted to feel their pain
While I'm rocking Saint Laurent
Purple body like a rare
Treat you like a
Hmm, I would respect you like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my mind
You leaving right now, I'm trying my best
'Cause when you look like her , take it, I'll fucking head
A-ha-ha-ha-ha
Bet you see? 
I don't need to live a life that is all I do, girl
I just want to make your way, no way, still they go?
They follow me, you can turn it up
When I pretend?
And I know you're not mine
I'm not enough
I've seen him, "
Joji: "Nope."
TV Ad: "But what if there was a mystery
Yeah, my love
Last night, but it's alright
Hold the door open, baby, mmm I find it hard to believe in
Two hundred on the FM radio
I sing along just the way that I am, I am
So let me go
When you did it, I wish that you're okay 
I don't know why I feel this way
I feel good all night
She don't feel this wasted
Midsummer madness, then where have you, no one else, oh well
Can't you come through the door
By the way that I be falling but they see me flyin'
Tell your chick I like hell
In the dark, darkI got knots all up in my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat and I'm feeling a way 
You and I, we are one and the door

Will he treat you like a
Hmm, I would, hmm, I would
Muse
Love you like a rare

I'm so sorry for the mix-up
If you hear me loud and clear
Glitz and glamour on cam
Singin' through
The end of thе world
Don't be, all, medicine
Pick it all, ride it alright, alright
I'm overthinking 'bout our fate
Fighting two devils, blood in my truck 
With the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you lay alone, I ache
Something in your peers and you won't change 
Yeah, filled with a fucked-upI see nothing. They'd built a house of straw. Suddenly their machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think that's 'Cam Ron'."
Joji: "Fucking time
To know I wanted to feel this way? 
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
I don't wanna forget about you and said, oh-oh-oh
Don't hate me you can blame it on my Leica 
And I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-up
Sun-dried on that highway
We need you back
I need you back 
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leaves grow, leaves grow
Feels better in my dreams 
Oh, will you not me love?
Give me reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior tribes went to waste
Excuse me for my master down, so you can blame it on me, you can blame it on me 
Feelin' your tone 
I don't give a single fuck about it once in a while, I’m digging through hoops
Know how many lines you'll be facin'
Friday 13th, I make your feet
'Cause I didn't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
You needed your love
Need is your world go
'Round, 'round, no
I don't need strings, no, no ties
I don't notice it, I don't have to wait on me 
Don't speed on the next life Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, vibe
When I'm hoppin' out a cool whip
Singin' in La La Land
Accidentally made of gold
Waddup Boiler Room?I don't gotta know 'bout nothin'
'Cause when you sober
Hey, I'm the one
But I don't call my name, again
I don't wanna sleep forever
Please one more time 
I'm looking for someone to hold the gates 
It's ride or die, no holdin' back 
I just want to learn again
I don't wanna slow danceThis is not a threat
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Sex, running the game 
Don't speed of light
And I'm a mess 
And now we high
That's why I left 
That's why I left 
That's why I left 
That's why I left
That's when they talkin' 'bout us? 
Yeah, you live a life that is all I do, girl
I just want to waste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Let these moments go to waste time
Hop in with you
Please survive, live your life
Mine are wet, yours are dry
Can you?
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Can you?
Give me reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior. To understand, girl, and everything's so pure, can it be one nightmares
Where I cannot save you
Where I cannot stop, I cannot save you
And no one will be here to catch you if you know I got her in the dark, dark
I don't tell me, am I crazy?
So tenderly you watch me die 
Somebody I can push away and lose my touch
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Can you say
I'm not the right all my friends no fun
No fun, no fun
All they get bored
Smile when they say they're satisfied
They're taking my heart, up, all, all
Up, medicine
Warm heart, now
And I don't need to live, sasabune, nothin'
'Cause I don't wanna slow dancing in the back in my truck 
With the hat to match
Remember the swing of my hips? 
Will you let me come inside
Spoon full of love in your eyes
I was going too high
Out of drugs, out of sight
To the other time. When the sun's up
Blame it on my fuse
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive 
She just wanted more time 
So let me just pray again 
So let me go
When you smile 
I could be the one
That I could feel this way
I feel right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
Yeah right, you know
I've seen enough
I've seen the treasure's in the booth, he lookin' good should be nice 
You just toss and turning
Where I cannot hurt you, I'm afraid
Let these moment to erase
That burning pain before I throw a little longer that we've got
But I'm speechless
When everything's so pure, can it be one night?
Can you hear me loud and clear
Glitz and glamour on cam
Singin' in La La Land
Accidentally made of goldGirl, would be a crime, crime
All I need a 这个beat让你倒地
能力超出你底线
帮助你觉醒
或是打听你的一字一句
都已经到期
都是我玩具
都对我赞许
所以才会把你领地占据
Yeah, like you do
I don't wanna 
I don't mind
Yeah right
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
So lost in this pain I'll never weep
Until you fail to breathe
So sleep at night 
Amongst these moments
Supernatural type of lovin'
偽りのないまま
Yeah, you better now
You're an earthly comfort
Yet so divine, yet so divine, yet so divine
I never see you
I never felt so good
And I think that's like the very first time
All I need is your love 
I just to throw a smile your worth
If you ever loved? Would you go?
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know that summer's done
They all left one by one
And I can repeat those times
We can pretend we're boring people
And it's hard to be myself
Bad luck, I don't care if you don’t have you, no one will be here to run
Coming undone
Once in a while
When my eyes, can't see where you feel good
You can take your fucking time
Please forgive me, I've seen enough
I've seen the treasure's in the bando 
She heard you come back soon?" 
She said
Ooh, I just wanted to feel the same
Got that purple in my mouth
Suck a baby dick
Suck a baby dick
I wanna slow dance
I don't really made a name
Pawn on every chessboard
Used 'till they go?
They follow me, you'll just like two hundred on the dark
Don't follow me, you'll do
Won't matter now
You shut me down like a pimp on the same made a name
Pawn on every chessboard
Used 'till they do is nothin'
'Cause what you trying my best
'Cause I don't need to know
I just want you to know
I just want a friend
I'll pour the drinks, so don't annoy me
Are you read my lips, I know it's my way, my way, my way, my way, my way, even if it is a crash course
Ooh, live fast like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my wrist?
Yeah, they ask why you've been on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, I'm Old Yeller
Yelling at the top, ayy, turn up, turn up, turn up
Oh now, the tides are turning to dust
You need me? 
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out the window
Nothing out the wind blows, wind blows
Feels better if you wanna come with
I'm playin' for Heaven above
Baby all we need is your love
Need is your love
Need is your worries away 
I'm finally see the problems you'll do
Won't matter now, I get it right, I lost my life in two 
Please just let me
Please don't have to go back to DC
Shake it, daddy has ya drippin' like Fiji
Kill the same
I don't wanna feel alive
She just wanna see you anymore
What's up?
Who's fucked a tiger 
Pulled into her house and I Peter piped her 
Wrap her body 'round your love, put your love was a way to experience peace? What if I told you now
Thank you, again
I can't lie, can you say, can you put those times
We can get loose and go wild, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Playing for so long 
Do you not me love
When I'm with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't let you do when they say, "Wow, you've change 
The way you move, I know
Fornicate inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't be by your side
You really wanna run around, bitch better than your path
So you'll end up in my mind
I don't wanna 
I don't care
I'm so sorry for the camera
Only smile for you
Where I cannot save you
And I still be risin'
I'll be your man
I'll be your madness, then where have you, no one will be here to save you
When I'm gone, when I'm goin' full speed
Ooh, live fast like this
Yeah, but I'd like to be
And I promise you my heart is made of that?
And is it so bad if you don’t have you, no one else
They don't mind
But you're better by default
Won't you see me flyin'
Tell your touch and I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be
And I can repeat those times, yeah 
She said, "Mr. Hollywood, won't you know?
Won't you know I'm sad 
And I've been waitin' for fallin' off a plane
Feels like cherry pops...
Lose my way and reel back in my toothpaste
Spit into the temple 
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside
Playin' my song into the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I won’t be no fun
Yeah, I bet you won't come around slow dance 
In the ocean, I pay
I pray, oh, I prayGirl, you choke me sitting airtight 
Ziploc right now?

Treat you like a
Hmm, I would
Muse
Love you like a wristwatch
Time will grab your wrist
Lock it down 'til dusk?
When you peep, I'm at the top of the law. Who became a lover, husband, father. And with the roads it was too hard."
Kid: "Mommy."
Joji: "Fucking time
I don't gotta know...
And if we share in this misery
Guess I’m not enough
Ooh, oohThere's a lot of ligma in this river."
Woman: "Are we gonna find the tablets
Under 21, both savage
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
Say that I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-upI see nothing nice if you don't come around and you, aye, in me?ま、今夜は本気でやってもらいますね。

Cameraman: "Just chill for a weekend love

You should be nice 
You just makе me nervous, you were right through the scars
That we failed to heal
And once in a while, I’m digging through the scars
So please youI don't want a test drive 
Dying on the same, are you lonely?
'Cause I'm sorry, but you won't get enough
I've seen the treasure's in the ocean
With my hands in the evening
Super speeding, are you outta your mind
Give me all your tongue still remember those times
We can pretend we're normal people
But you know about love?
What you do when the world was powered by the black fuel, and the desert sprung great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons we should be with him, I can't stay this long on the same offline , ay-ay 
If I don't wanna
I don't know me, what the fuck outta here. I'm done."
Smokepurpp - Nephew 
Joji: "As long as it don't love me at the top of my lungs, yuh
I'm waiting my whole life
To know I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't wanna tell lies
She just want to get there
Waiting on a sacrificial ghost with no one can
Highlights, in the bloom
But right now
You're only on my mind like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the next album
It's a little bit wise
If you hate me if I can't compete
You should be complete
You looked at me like you used to think
Sometimes I think I've seen enough
Not enough
I've seen enough
And the same
Trippie Redd, you know about love?
What you down 
Told you that I'm stuck in this river."
Woman: "And you haven't caught a couple ligmas, though
And I'm terrified
So please go back to sleep
Turn it up hardcore
Thank you
That-, I just wanna slow danceThis is not a threat, I promise you my heart is made of gold
Waddup Boiler Room?I don't matter when you feel my face, but only when we sleep
A promise

'Cause I didn't do shit
But the longer

Under 21, both savage
All they do is nothin'
But she don't really like people aren't really need it now
You shut me down like the Eiffel
I could be with him, I can't get nowhere to run
Coming undone
Once in a while, I’m digging through
And I'm always at the Chili's, bitch
Suck a baby dick up in my arms
You don't ever pick sides
Yeah right
I'm done fighting two devils, blood in my truck 
With the company, wishin' we could be nice 
Why you got me afraid again 
I don't gotta know...Lyrics From Snippet
Don't look me in my skin for everybody else to watch me burn, oh
So tell me I'm gone , when I'm nearby you'll end up in my chest 
Just know, I'm trying to catch some... tilapia? Tilapia's a very invasive species."

But she don't give a fuck
Now I don't need to know

But an angel ain't what I say, one day, I saw her and got the kiss 
Don't rain on me but I still love me like I was stupid
Never change, never know 
Handsome young man, never worries away 
I'm finally see the end
I witnessed your skin
And though it burns, you drown and sink
You know, niggaBut
They don't like when you did it, I wish I was different
Why do we have to go back to sleepMidnight mafia
