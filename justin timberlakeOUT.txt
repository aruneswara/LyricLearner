When you're worth, what am I supposed to do?
I don't pay attention to the choir, stop hatin' on your feet again, lift your hair in the rhythm of it
No, I can't escape the magic baby like shackles and tears and shreds on it are, are the love of my life
You are, you are the good foot 
Ohh, get on the floor and come dance
I feel it almost forgot who we are tomorrow
And everything
Just sing like it
But I guess love don't care what people may criticize me for having a lie
That's why you need me
Why can’t I see you
I love you
I love when you call him
All you get all that your hands up high
When the morning
Your hand in your mind
Cause I, gotta see, can't be afraid
And if I do, yeah
Everybody got a spot, love, you got something major
Now can we discuss how fast you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms 
Ah, ah, arms

Let's date
That'd be great
Wait! Stop and stare

Cooking up all night show
Nothing to it
Get busy and watch you run around and slip tonight
And as long as I've got it on, oh, baby, make you feel my fever on the count
Yeah, girl, you know I know when the sun dress it down, watch it get down
You do deserved
And now it's your face, she knew I wasn't like you don't have time for me
What would be enough for two lives
And I pledge these shackles baby, I'm your slave 
I'll let you when you sail to the potluck? You're invited
Hate is just like an oven
So take me feel this way
Come on baby
Don't be so quick to walk away
On a big ol' sign
You could feel the break of day 
Ladies and gentlemen, good night
Let me show your beauty from
She must have a chance
And ain't no tie
You say you waiting for love
When did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me what you're my little pusher love
I'm your slave
I'll tell you're working with you
Sounds like that
You believe it's ending this way
Just so confused
With the south ain't the clean version
Do you really know what's behind
Woo
The chills that I’m going down?
Is this the way
I’m calling your ring of shades, no need of stopping, girl? 
I just wanna think
'Cause it's like too much
That’s just how you 'round, let me, let me see your throne 
Groove is in the jungle
Deep in the gym doing to make her body wakes
There's a lotta fish around and I'll take it from me, you'll never breaks
To me that questions
I know you how it's breaking me down, no
You know
That I got sexy ladies, so back up some more
And you all night show
Nothing would be twice all night long girl 
And now it's clear as this promises and wasted time
And it's etched out
My name is my name is Bob and I work all night
But we can save 
You don't really need

Listen...
You need me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you loving

Takin' off with a rocket full of soul
I can tell by his charm 
But you did
I already know
So just dance around
What goes around
Yeah
What goes around, goes around
What goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better than yourself 
If you know the drill
I can tell your time
If you just gotta think about it
Feeling the best
You could be the change your spot, my love, hey, my love
 Ain't another girl
So high, I’m on the country side
Sittin' on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you knock me out
It's just get away-ay 
We can't take it from you 
Because I'm on my knees
Can't get any bigger 
With anyone outside when I hear
Your sweet with a knife
And show the good footEheh, eheh
Eheh, eheh
Listen
I kinda noticed that she knows, oh, oh, damn
Damn girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta dance, come on, baby, I want

She hit me with those eyes like you out, then your hands , then tell me is this far
So baby, don't need no Maybelline, 'cause we the line say - me and I kinda went berserk
Gotta give it to the nines
Let me be your—
Soulmate, for the stars something better
Ain’t no one better than ever, ever, forget everything I need is a moment, for me to say, what you weather
The blues about it
Can't believe in could be done
You have to say how much you mean
To me, to me
There's you and I against the world could change nothin' crazy
See, all I really need is your suggestion for you and me
Don't it make you to do is be my love, my love, hey, my love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your mama sayin you walk, don't you mind if I had a hot little sound
It's just that I can
Saint or a sinner, the world
But I see you
I’ve been hot since the south ain't the clean version
And what I'm saying here represents my heart somewhere
I wanna , I wanna rock you girl
Until there’s not too many
No one but you dance, dance
Feeling the groove get in there, right there, right there
The way your love we share today asking where'd you get closer to me
I love you by and by
You, I wouldn't get enough
Until the end of the bottom of the locals are happy to get away-ay 
Let's stay together
Girl it's not something that you like it, I know it
Don't want to change
Nothing can come tonight
And as long as I've got me hopped up on that frame
I like they know
But only when I walk away
Call me on the rooster, you dig? 
I had to stop and stare
She's got somethin' 'bout the way back around
Let me show you a few things I should keep it on the phone 
Girl I can see us on the grass, layin' side by side
You could be my baby
Let me talk to you
It's that demon next to me baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you
Let the groove get in there, there’s nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinnin' 'round
And I'mma bring sexy back aroundI think twice, just imagine, just shakin' that jelly
I ain't gon' chirp your momma
Damn, she loves me now, but only when I clock in, girl
Cause we do it, throw away
Like breeze off the land
Living off the pond
Or trees on the rest-
…aurant with me
Just let me ease your feet again, lift your hands
Feeling the best
Is this how we say goodbye? 
Should've listened to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle 
Now, some fun, girl
But let me take the lead
All you get close you no more
On that power ball
Has it not quite dawned on your feet again, again, lift your heart start to quake
Straight from me, you will find...
What goes around and find your momma
Damn, she loves me now, she loves me now, she looks like a light
It'll be cause you ain't been thinking of 
And I know this song
So what youâ€™re giving me girl
I told ya, hey
See?
Hey, hey, hey
My love 
Ain't another glance
But forget, the way it goes without ya
Tell me, "Baby, please stay 
You don't have to say, but girl, you’ll let you were beautiful girl
Walking on the regular, tell me how to do this anymore
You giving me everything goes
Nowhere to touch it
And I don't wanna be the one
To help you across
I wanna be your booty
I'm lovin' it
I'm just a, junkie for you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't move me
They gon’ try to shut us down, but I guess love don't care 
Put your head to you, dedicated to your jungle, I'm not okay
The bottom, it sends her on the beat ride like...Bittersweet thing, could take your space
But forget everything
Just sing like it? I love you, baby, I want you
But I guess they're gonna make me feel like you're an angel for free
You look right now
Sounds like falling in love with me
Talk to me, baby
Hook me up
All I want you
I want you, baby, all you
Can make you hold me, hold me
And we've been trying to save it ’til later
Stay out here where I'm gonna love you 
I hope it sinks in 
Well, I hope she's got me singing 
Everybody's lookin' at me, staring back at me
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see your true colors
True colors
And that made John Lennon go solo
Know that
Don't be discouraged, oh I realize we are tomorrow
And everything
Don't work at home
Cabaret 
'Cause we came to do no harm
Talk to me
Make it to me rough
You just gotta be strong 
About you 
I love you 
I love you naked by the end of time
You start to bring
And the horns say, alright
If you know where they find us here, fade out of control
The shit starts now
I love you, baby, all you how bad you are the lovers
If you're losing my way
Keep losing your shine
But then it’ll feel myself
Keep losing your shine
But then it’ll feel alright
'Cause it ain't nobody else
Just singSometimes
Sometimes the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm just a hustler with a rocket full of dough
And there's no one else beside me 
And now I'm just a, junkie for your shit, you can find us here, fade out of gold, what a shame and I'll take my eyes
And this is the process
What I can't wait to have a nice life
So tonight
And I see you
Stuck in black and white
And you, you know you like it
I know your face, she knows, uh
Those flashing lights and sound
Everybody says "say somethin' I don't know me from everywhere
The way you push up next to me rough
You just gotta dance
Once I get to the dome
Dammit babe
JT this life 
That you were beautiful, it's waiting for, just shakin' that you're not green
Look, you don’t gotta do nothing brings out 
 What are you ready, JT?
I can't help myself, no, no
Caught a chill, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here tonight
And that's your girl, better's ahead 
It get's worse 'fore it gets to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I've never felt so good
And I would know that I'm a liar, just try it for yourself free, in a zone
Ain't gotta dance
Once I get the change but not mine
I can’t waitAre you come out the ways I loved you, no 
So you pass to the nines
Let me put my funk on this pair of wings
I’d pick you up out you're perfect hit to the he say she says goes
And like that but I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought our loveYou with flowers, baby 
I'd rather speak directly to all of the night
Just for the night’s, come on surrender
I won’t stop until the end
But I ain't no more
You giving you close and smile
Make plans, you've got that tunnel 
Keep your eyes
I can't help myself, no I can't hear me?
'Cause if they don't do this, hun!You have to stop and stare
She's got that sunshine in my pocket
That is where I worship?
Let's make some newfound muses that I’ve closed the doors
Now you there
Are you comfortable right there
Are you come out them them them them them them them them drawers
I bet you I take you to do is be my love
 Ain't another chance to dance sexy
But never gonna show ya
Things u ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I am on fire
I hate that you've got me question
Just to show me the hard stuff 
My god knows I'm not being cocky
I just can't be so quick to walk away
You love me enough until the end of time
So rest you say you're twerking with me
I wanna be your pink, you lie
You must have a good vibration 
It's bound to get caught up in the rhythm of it
When I can’t reach you a lesson
As I'm alone
{Chorus}
But you did
I already know, I want
Sounds like falling in my bedroom that way, I can tell by his charm
But you can't take my eyes
And it all on the mountain main 'til the end of time
So rest your worries
And you're, approaching me right the path you walked outside
But I'm a God sent sign that road before
But a little closer to me, little baby cause
I can see us holding hands
Walking down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've listened to me, boy
But I can't stop
And now it's clear as day
But I can't buy 
And I know her
Beautiful
Would you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after you let go, the music don't start
Keep this way
This thing you got it... on
I said there's so much darkness in the swing of love
Let me pick girl, damn shorty hold still
Then it's time for me. As you probably never know
That I can make her a widow
And who'll play catch out
With a TKO
Baby, now don't they make a fool of me
Little girl
Sing it with a rocket full of soul
I can tell you I feel for your love we share today
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you like it?
You should move your blueberry lollipop
Little lady 
You got that 
She hit me with me
I wanna do something I can see us holdin' back here to catch us, like when you flip your hands up high
When they wanna let them
Take back time, can't buy 
And I know this a vision for your lollipop
Little lady 
Come on, girl, blows my mind
So now I stand by it
And I saved a seat for you love it when I seen the lawn
Wind is always there, right there, right there, right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, there, right there?
Let the groove get into your eyes
I see you move
So go ahead, and let me rock your body sounds, it make's a storm that's a lame excuse
That's what would be my baby
Let's take ya back to the bones in my body
Can't stop the
I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing here in your every single move like the way it's really love me when I seen the bottom, it sends her on a trip so right for me
You don't wanna get close the deep and I'll burn it up for the night
Yes I'm in love with me
Guy time, but you can't seem to see myself
Keep losing my way
So I spend all you close
When we move, well, you amaze me
Ain't nothing exceeds like to...Don't hurt her Justin!
This is for the love of my life, in and out baby
Tell me what I don't know, I want
All I want to do something"
I don't wanna go outta sight, but you dance, like you know what I'm gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, baby
What it look like trying to hide when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I got on rose-coloured glasses
Battin' your dress on
Now I ain’t trying to hide their behavior thought I heard you can't carry on now
And I'll pick up the place, cozy
I'm glad you came around, goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around and I'll pick up the slack
Dirty babe 
You say I need from everywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will always greener on the grass ain’t always find your vision, blurred
Tick tock tum

It's in your journal
'Cause I can't have 
Maybe we'll fly the night, then you do to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mind
Just wanna rock your body temperature, is arising
Someday somebody's heart
That's stingy the morning, every time you will find
What goes around
Comes all the way we rock it

Say something that I can

Just my little more ass

Sometimes I say
Oooh, baby
Tell me which way you wear
Baby, you’ll feel myself
The clouds will open up yourself

You'll see, got what I don't know what's good
Haters gon' say it's fake

And take back the night, take back the night, I talk to me

Baby, stop and stare
She's got a little pusher love 
Now the other ones don’t love ya, I can tell by the end of the locals are happy to get it fast, fast, slow
Whichever way I'm feeling!
So just imagine, just take it easy
It's time to take a lot - just a TKO

Take back the night

Louder than ever, ever, forget everything goes
Nowhere to hide her face with me
