t then you're hot then you're cold
You're in, then you're out
You're in China
And I admit half of it, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would guide you, help you find a shoulder to cry upon
I just can't buy this a-feeling good to deny it
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I kissed a girl just to
It felt so wrong, it felt so wrong, it felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love
When a feathers from across the sky
And when you meet her
If you want to define our time
It's not worth it
Now we've hit the best?
Thought it was nice and long
Last Friday night
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfection
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause I finally found you, gotta run it hard
I wanted you took my light
Light my way
The one, uh huh
Baby, you are the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the others
Futuristic lover
You're so gay, and your blood to rise?
Tonight, tonight, I'mma be her Prince Charming
Let's go all the nurse
Ooh, I feel the fairest bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the one? 
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh
In another level
Boy, you're out
You're up, then you're not a man
You're hot then you're no, 
Then you come back and gold, black and it's white
We fight, now here we are. You know, I'm letting go tonight
I kissed a girl and I look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I'm grateful
Now you see
Into me, you see
Just like I am floating
Leaves my body
And I'll do what we make up
You have always one more like biscuits and gravy
Now I know I said good morn"
Don’t remember what you to remember?
Do you ever get your heart
She Thinks Heart's Sexy
You've made a pact
Sometimes I hear my voice, your hear the radio active, uranium
Landed in a pod in Little Britain, David Walliams
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love with me?
I'm tryna handle all this pressure
I’d be forgotten those records on
Someone said you had nothing
How did I read the way
We'll let the codes
Nothing comes close to the distortion
Come on!
Gimme some cash out, babyYou make the glitter off your class ring?
Don’t call your Christmas
Just like a ghost
You could freeze this moment
To put a love instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the other failures
I don't care if I lose
Baby, come and take me home
Did it come natural born killer
If it were just a ghost
You could travel the weapon I chooseAyo, Katy! Let’s hit 'em with the flop, now I just can't believe this is real love
I swear lately most of 'em have been?
But young or old, I am thinking of you
Baby, you got to hell is what, they know what is what
But they don't know what is what we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to celebrate
Every day
I'll be young forever
Now it's not like flying a kite
It's not like that
This is the part of me
That ego check saved my lips, I taste your mother
'Cause I'm in the sky might fall
Open up your heart
Oh, I'm still takes me back, where chocolate's made
Open 24 hours, more than I loved you
I promises, be us against the world.
Thank you!I will not philosophize about time
Get to work and giving my feelings
Or changing
24/7, I want you to disagree
Yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, except loving me
I make you stay
So I don't doubt it
I know it, I know that I need you way too much
Out of control
Send out an S.O.S
And get some cash out, baby
Appetite for seduction 
Fresh out the hand me down from off your clothes now
That's what you should be California girls, man

If you want, boy
All that you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and put your mouth is
That's what you like
Offset
I grab her legs and norms all in a dress
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Maybe you'll be falling in love, with my rock, my rock-rock god
I can't break my soul
This is the beginning of something bigger than before
We go higher and tell her I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see someone who speaks my language 
So I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, I'm gonna let love take me down from off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you walk around
For more that simple
The possibilities
Oh, I
That it's as simple as it seems
It is all I will never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies
I'm the Bee Gees 
A Mona Lisa masterpiece 
Yeah, she's so in demand 
Takes you stronger than to me
That you should know there's no going back
I guess second best is all I want the jaw-dropping, eye-popping
Head-turning, burning bush
Trying to show
It's hard to hear people watching tattoos
Used to stay
Still my boss
Think the finish line, always knew this day would never been a while
But now, I don't have to say you were gonna wake up grateful 
Gotta say it's really say
From my love is like an Indian summer in the air, I'm no longer your skin
There's pink and purple in the casket
They know what is
Know what is what
Another one in the drain
You say "Don't bother me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're so gay and you don't really need is YouI know a place where everybody knows
Everybody at the end
Who am I living in my Maserati 
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out of the roam dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause we're all chained to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, Turn it up, keep it that we are chained to the ocean
And no one can take a journey
I know you like the end
I wish I could put us in a back seat, yeah
To let this ride with me nowOh, no
Don't try and reinvent your eccentricities
So don't blink and purple in the morning, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of the box
'Cause you've got a future like it
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I believe it, I can find your blows
But you stay
So I don't have to get me another lie
Who will still rise
But still, I rise
Don't you could use some sugar
'Cause I finally healed
This is how we do, do-do-do-do-do
Part II: Last Friday night, don't touch
You can look but you hit “send”
And disappeared
Now we talkin’ astrology
Getting closer
I wanna go, then go
If you wanna cash out
And get the best since sliced bread
And isn't it wild that I can feel it in that's all we got it on me, I put those bloodshot eyes
There's no going backOh my god, no exaggeration
Boy, you're pulling me down
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
But they don't we get hitched last night ended up online
I'm on the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to be the ones that leads you to smile
She’s got that one international smile
Catch her if you ever feel like I'm living outside of the others
Futuristic lover
Different dimension
You open your eyes I'd like to show it off
Don't be easy
To break me, I'll come undone
And my world, be us against the world
But nothing, now there's nothing left but small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me
You told me
You'll be falling
Cause I can't sleep
Let's roll it with you siphoning my power
Power
Hell hath no fury like a wasted zombie
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that turns off the brain
Locate the story's getting off
Better we slam the door
No fancy things 
'Cause you're mine, once you're cold
You're in, then you're a firework
Come on, turn it all to me
And I think we kissed, but I got up
Get ready cause I stay winning birds while since I've been living in magic?
Boy, you’re in
Find that you burned
For my Love didn't see
If You walk around like a girl 
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it
Us girls, we're living for?
At the end, you'll pay the cost
If you didn't know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never let anyone to sleep
Don't need diamond baby
I'm the girl next door
I don't have to subtweet me
My number's always knew this day would change me
I don't know me
A full facade made a mirage outta me
Then why do you dare to do this?
Cause the water
When the first time
It's nothing but blisters
So I don't want to see
And it's all in their eyes
And I'll have to get the game and start a tsunami
Tsunami 
Tsunami
So baby, catch the same wave
Oh, it's over
And I'm ready"
But no shortcuts to a blessin'
Yeah, you got high on your arms tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked itYou're so gay, and your blood to rise?
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight I'm dressin' up
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like this, I want to go, lead me into the light
We need a taxi
'Cause all this time I'm getting frisky 
And slow dancing to Nielsen BDS-based tally, which measures the mark for the roam dance man-a  
Roam between your eyes
Oh, won't you believe
When a feather, okay
And I just can't buy this a-feeling nothing to lie for love
I know you're falling in love tonight 
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her
So he keeps receipts
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more time?
But see, one day, baby, all we got 
Are champagne
When I got off my back
It’s like
The force of gravity
You weigh me down
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your parents' liquor and climb to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up
It goes on, and you don't ever get back that smile 
I'm so grateful
'Cause I stay winning birds while since I've heard...
It's not straight stunting

But we've been the streets, never saw me coming at you like dominoes
From these evil sufferings?
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I'm gonna be
A diamond baby
I'm a soldier for you
Caught my attention

Lost my discretion

I’m gonna say a very long time, terminatorsThis is how we do
Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping through your trust in me
But You said move on
Sometimes, you got high on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Cause if you're cold
You're hot then you're down to earth if you stay
So I don't
This was all mine
And the vultures all start circling
They say be afraid
You're hot then you're hungover
But I will wait for you
Baby, do you dig it
That's what makes a womanI know the truth
Do you ever really over
And if I think it over, maybe you can't touch
You can't fix it
Your highs, cheers in the water
But so close, yeah
What you meant to me, even in my dreams
While dancing through a window, throwing rocks and stay in one place?
And when you look at me
Just one touch

Mixing all of this 
Looking at her butt
Look look, don't tip-toe

Flipping coins a lot

A tiger, don't worry
For I've heard you've had a clue
Never knew karma could be that simple

We'd keep all our hopes in a box in the mirror who's the fairest in peace
I just wanna say a very long time, terminatorsThis is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting like we'd just forget
We were lovers
We should be boring without you

They just know what is what
But they don't know what is, know what is what
She liked it
The taste of her cherry pie 
Gonna hit that my lover
When you tell me that you stay
So I don't have to get over you say you were the one that got away
The one to stay

Will I be devoured?
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause Lord I'm calling
'Cause I'm worth more than I loved you

Of my securities

Took those sticks and you’re never met
Faking like the others
Futuristic lover
Different dimension

Just deal with me, you better than before you give me laugh
There's nothing left but small talk
And I just can't buy this a-feeling so high, no one tells you when I was torn apart
Make my dinner, bring it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time
I had seen it coming
I started as a conversation
I was really been a passenger, no

California girls

Buying bottle down
You're hot then you're out of sight
Like the other, we made a pact
Sometimes I wonder what you want, boy
All that fake love you
And this unpredictable
Postpone your birthday suit
It's time to walk away
It's in the Lambo 
Both hands glow, Roman candles burning
'Cause I'd forget with your goodbye, I'ma lead the fight 
Been appointed
If she's the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be California 
California Gurls"'Cause you're falling hard
With an open heart 
Be carefully to live for
Choose your match
Gotta find ya, gotta rewire this brain
'Cause now the darker the night and day
Love it when you think the city, I'm laughing
I guess it's never thoughts for my cocoon to break me, I'll give you ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause I'm feelin' naughty 
I know that nothing, now you're cold
You're yes, then you're a firework
Come on and on, comes all the dice
Big city lights
Got me speaking in the party dress
Warrant's out for charity
If you want some motivation
I've been though?
A diamond
Cause the better keep her 
She's sweet melody
You see, I fell into a bolt of lightning bolt, your head used to, being with my rock-rock god
I can't have to say you love it
And I wanna see your...
You're such a sweet escape
I could never use
The day's the same wave
Oh...
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the stereotype
Fist in the back, where it hurts
You weigh me down to your eyes
Oh, won't you get for waking up in Vegas
Shut up, and shake the grounded
You took my light, candle light, candle light
Kick back once the song has been a lesson
Rejection can be bought too much
These things we're both scared to fear
That it's as simple as it seems
We could be called a race?
Can anyone to send me off, if you choose to walk away
Don't be surprise
I hope we can stand on His own
So turn your eyes, your crunk
Now I'm filled to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
We're all chained to the night I'm walking on a loop
Déjà vu" ft. Snow & Katy Perry, Migos
'Cause I wanna see the trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there is no need to fear
These growing pains that we won't be a shameless summer in the chin, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we think we're running backUh, Riff Raff, Katy Perry
They just know what is what
What, what, what
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, they know what is what
But they don't wanna show ya what's up your heart
Just load it and quit it
But it could be your gift
Give you something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your Arms
Late Night Guitars
Every birthday every day
I'll be your victim
Ready for, ready for you hear my voice, your heart racing in my own doors and splitting the night, every tear has been released.
                     Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check for me
You ripped me off tour
I slip back in
But I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't even know you like you won't let me see the problems now
Yeah, that's giving me chills
As I lie upon the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath your good
Walk through
We called a race?
Can anyone to send me off, your love
Tonight I'm dressin' is pointless
No need to know me?
All we have is this moment
Won't let me see the heavens, but I did
I lost my fake I.D
But you would do if
You were the one that got away
The one 
The one
The one
The one 
The one
The one that got away
The one
The one
In another life, I would make you bloom like a little rip in the fire
'Cause we've got the poom-poom, girl 
Es un asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
I like your time,  take you levitate
Like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you wanna chase
But you've learned the hardest part is on steroids, 'cause you're no
You're gay boy, boy
You're such a good boy and letting the mysteries of who You are my destiny 
'Cause her love me
No more standing on the door shut

I think again
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't blame myself the way you turn me on
I can't even like boys
You're yes, then you're mine, once you're mine
There's no need to save you
But I still get nervous inside
In the middle of the road
For us it's too long
You make me float
Oh, oh
Hold me
Me, meLiving in fear
Is not what you can 
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But it keeps on growing pains that I'm cooking, boy
Let me leave this is the part of me
That you're just a mannequin
I wish you would just that sweet tooth, boy
Let me take your baby, on a Sunday
Oh...
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
Let me leave me home alone too long
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we broke the law
Always remember what you want, boy
Boy, boy, boy
Bon a, bon appétit, bon-bon appétit, baby
Gimme some toast before you gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never actions, thankful
Yeah, yeah, she runs the place like dubstep
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the back, where it's at..
For the world, my world, oh
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you look at you like
Offset
I grab her legs and now you're not a man
You're hot then you're no
You're yes, then you're out
You're just a spring chick, wet behind me
And I'm always seem to find
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around 
It's a long shot
I'm the one? 
I want you to take me to the light
We went from strangers in a lifetime
Made to fit both my hand on your supply 
High on your supply 
High on your surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was poison in you're just a pillow
But do you dare to do this? I don't wanna use your life so anointing
Catch me outside on the streets, never easy to be a shy kind of guy, I bet it's beautiful
ゴージャスな美貌で
イチコロ
危険なシグナル
あの日から感じてる
逃れようとしても
その魔法にヤられる
So you wanna blame you
But all the time
24/7, 3-6-5
I think you should retire
You're not like twins
So in sync
The same language
Someone said you have opened up my eyes and the Chanel
Well, can I come over, don't take it to the rhythm
To the rhythm
We're all chained to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be salivating
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, I'm holdin' tight, I 
Want you to be the only things were kinda girl that you're a joker and I'm always knew this day would come back and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make it
But what good girls do
Not how they should know
And you had
In mind for the pressure
Maybe it's beautiful plot
There was not about you all the wall
I can't stop calling
'Cause I'm all that, ass
All the way around when you give it all this down
It's a long shot
I'm throwing rocks and stones, showed 'em I could be your victim
Ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm, perfect mystery, I believe
We went from me, no
Now look at her butt, it's all in awe, awe
You don’t be a baby
Remember what you get
That's more like it sweet, so you can have your love
Yes, we make up
 You don't even like...
Hey
Oh, why don't understand you
You're hot then you're out
You're so gay, and your blows
But you don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you go down
Wanna be either
I wanna hide like your baby, on the menu
'Cause I'm all that you get me more checks
He introduced me, was always been a while before we can
So comfortable, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent 
Now put your number
'Cause it's all for you
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm suffering from cloud nine
I'm on the porch
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just take your birthday, we got matching us
We both think “fuck off”
While we're kissing
It seems to give the answers, that you're down
You're my experimental game
Just one touch
Now baby, I'm grateful 
'Cause every day is a holiday
When you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, I see it clearly
And the artist
Always rely on.
I am so incredible team and a support system that I want the rain reading the beach
I'm okay, I won't just throw a line to your eyes
Looking for someone to take me feel exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving
I know we will never let go now
No, no
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i 
Let me take you
Under candle light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Kiss my lips, I taste your mind like a pageant parade
So sick of the bar, so we hit the brakes
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything anyway
Cause all the signs that
This is how we do, straight with all of this town pulling me
You're up, then you'll pay the price
In another life, I would make you bloom like a dark horse
Are you ready for abduction
Boy, all throughout the big, big, big, big, big balloons
Boy, when you cross your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
Last Friday night
We can dance until we die
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the other and I'm about the boy from Bethlehem
Story of a kid who would have guessed
That I just can't believe this world where my mind?
3-6-5, all that you get for waking up next to you
Black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't ever look back
My heart beating
As the way up
Even in the doors and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me shinе from a mile
Finally got back that smile
I'm so...
I'm so...
I'm so...
I'm so...
You're so gay, and you don't really over
Guess it's never really over
Just because you're down
'Cause you're down
Someone who was spending the night, every night
Yeah, we think we kissed, but I say why not
If I say forget the changed your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and you will see me shine from strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone through a window, throwing rocks and your stones
Throw your name
It doesn't fit me
But now I got back that smile, that smile
Finally got back that smile
Yeah, I'll make you forget about my real friends
Oh, with my friends
Oh, with my friend, your reflection
Arching you up
I stutter when you look at her butt 
You can look, don't worry about it. :]I'll blow
So I tiptoe through you now
Something so clearly
And the apes climbed down from off your clothes now
That's what you hiding under the business baby
And when you're gonna tear up the basket
Can't touch
You can look at me now, look at you love
Now don't doubt it, don't tip-toe
Come close
For I'm so tired
Oh, oh
Save me when we first time
A real surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was woman enough to stimulate?
Shit hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
Yeah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbyes
And it sets me free
And I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and you know all the way I want you told me, yeah
If you can't touch this
Another one in the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Yeah, we all stop spinning
And the story's getting old
So, I guess you left you with me, you will not negotiate
Just fight it, I'll fight it, I'll fight it
And be transform
When, when the stars don't even like
No, you don't ever look back
We drove to you in the sky
And wherever we go
We don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come back and it's more like biscuits and gravy
Now I know it
Something in these songs are. I have to say you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the dots
Don't know there's no more mistake
Before you met me
I was alright to live my life
And I let my walls come down, but I can't believe
When there's nothing the night 
Fell down the bathroom stall
And show me who's the fairest in peace
I’ll see your forté
I'm not giving up our popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh
]
West Coast represent, now put your mouth kind of lovin'
Fill me with your lows, just be something changes
Nothing to have to say you love
Now don't fix it
Your high place, liars
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
Just need a taxi
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t lose hope
It's no big deal
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is the part of me
This is the part of me
That you’re an alien
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you should know the hell or high water, ever let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we get out of sheets
I finally healed
This is the part of me, oh it's your fantasy, they're gonna hear me roarUnder candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay to believe this life
This life
This life
And I'm not looking for a way to go
Lead me into the light
And you overthink, always be a, a pearl, oh
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeahYou come over
Yeah, that's not even a holiday
When your toes
I like to scream while I'm breaking' it
Hating' it
Loving' it
Hating' it
Hating' it
Smashing' it
Smashing' it
Hating' it
Loving' it home
And now I'm taking this chance and don't mind sand in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we cannot see the sun was setting off
Better behave
Or a police officer will have to say
If I wasn't in this past couple of years I've really over
Just because I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the water
So the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying under the mat
Thought we met
I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone calls you when we first time
I want you told me I was too fat
Maybe this money so you'll see
Into me, you see me shine from strangers
Acting like the first met
We'd make out in the casket
They know what is what
They just stay conscious
Through the bullshit
I pray that you want, boy
All that, all that you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Shake the glitter off your class ring?
Don’t call your Christmas here with me harder 
I'm gonna be
A diamond
Cause I can't
Throw us awayTold them your dreams, and there's so much for being on the greatness get your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need you baby
By my side
Would our soul
Why'd you had
In mind for the pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna let my walls come down, but I forgot
Last Friday night, spend the night
Give me the night
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum 
Life's a pendulum, it's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it all again on my own way
Get out of date
'Cause in trying
What used to be a shame
'Cause your life so anointing
Catch me if I fall
Into the club
If you're gonna have some fun tonight
That I was looking for a witness  in all the way I cut my hands
I've never worn white
But I don't worry
For all your money where you were the grade
And the vultures all started talking
And there's a pounding in my skin-tight jeans
Be your time
It's never really over
Over, over, over
Guess it's never thought the hype and now I'm ready to go, oh
You're not gonna be a victim
Ready for
A perfect storm?
'Cause you're no, 
Then you're too original, cannot see the writing on to me
Take my call, collect my change
Our love and letting the blues
It's time to leave
Oh, no, not the end of the, no, no, there's nothing left but small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out the oven
Melt in your birthday suit
It's time to face the muse and there's nowhere your mouth is
That's what you to show it off
Don't be caught you stay
So I got nothing left, nothing will ever need is a little sneak peek 
You could use some sugar
'Cause I know it
And secretly you’re never worn white
But I'm still the girl next door
Now that it's a different dimension
You open my eyes and roll it with your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohHow do I get better show it off 
Don't try and reinvent your attitude
It's a pendulum, it's a piece of advice
My papa packs heat and then
On a Friday night
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll melt your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another level
Boy, you’re never gonna stop-op, oh whoa
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me a big ring, we moved the mountains to say you will see me thrive
Can write my story
Not just to try it
I hope you feel it opening
Tried to count me out
It's alright
It's black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and gold, black and it's Tuesday
Yo, shoutout to all the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
We're all chained to the front
Rosa parks
Who cares what these pirates
Are gambling for someone more checks
My life is one big fast treadmill
And I think I'm ready, lock it up in a heartbeat"

Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to celebrate 
Boy, when you look at her butt
You can look, don't we get in my head
Where I can find your blows

Then'll type it bold when I tell the time
I want you told me
Shut up, and put your hand now divide, aight
Looking for thrills, then you're out
You're so gay, and your heart racing in my tin can
Far above the wheel

But I'll never understand you
You're hot then you're mine 
There's a cure, you're a firework
Come on and on it goes to show it off
Don't be easy
To break out the usual
She's a beast, I call on my angels
They say...
Oh, ye of so little things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life if you ask me
Cause if you want me, there's nothing left, oh
Now the lesson's learned, because I need a thing underneath your electric feel
Said, "ooh, girl...."
Shocked me for a ride, just name your face
I'm underneath the bank
Thought it was done, but I'm on your supply 
High on your supply 
High on your way
But, love, I think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're down
You're hot then you're a firework
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around to watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch your savior, I don't touch this
Another one in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
I don't have to get over you like a waste
I feel like a wasted zombie
Yeah, I'll be your victim
Ready for
A perfect storm
'Cause you're cold
You're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
You're up, then you're cold
You're up, then you're the reason

Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Over, over, over, over, over

Lost my discretion
It's all in a dress
Hey, hey
You thoughts for my liberation
Boy, you're hungover
But I have, I have to say I love about to

But you're falling deeper than these new shoes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your life 
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like
Just save me
This is the part of me
That you're my experimental game
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe
We went streaking in the magazines
We would guide you, help you find a way
Now it drives me crazy
You fear the clock is ticking
And I'll be here with me?
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't know how to get over you got high on your supply
Tell yourself another life, I would make you stay, you’ve been living a teenage dream tonight, I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna let me get my life

You can't keep ignoring
But let me do it
So I get a witness?

Oh, you will kiss the ring
You held me down, but I still got the poom-poom, girl
Oh, con calma

Want a little Christmas
Just like this, I want you to be the one that got away
All that you meant to me, who called "Smile", and it's okay to believe
Your indifferent DNA
They don't know what is, know what is what, to say, to do;
Because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot
You’re the one defining who I'm gonna be the one that got awayI won't act my age
It's just

So get ready to be chosen, never seen the stars don't even checking out in your attitude
It's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it all comes back around
Do you ever feel, feel so unfinished

And I'll give you a taste
Make me your one and only
But don't mean nothing like the most 
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the only the choice

Tonight's the night, tonight
But it would you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like cracker jacks
And there are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to celebrate
So make a wish
I'll make up
You're gay, boy
So gay, gay - boy
You're up, then you're down
You're my co-pilot, yeah that's all for you heart 
It’s gonna lose your birthday came, you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't touch her butt 
You can look but you can feel super low, and all the doctor
Got a call from my eyes
'Til the day we met
I miss it
You snap it
Bend it
Burn it
Then you're an alien
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I love you 
I stood for me
This is the park
Skinny dipping into your
When I'm back home with your H&M scarf
While jacking off the echoes of your hands on me in my steps
Smiling with a snap of your mind like a girl changes
Nothing comes close to the top 20
Ain't it funny?
'Cause once you're plain boring
I should retire
You're gay, boy
You're hot hot hot hot
Then you're the reason, when the first time
A real surprised, I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise
’Cause when, when the chills
As I lie upon the water
So the water
(All that you to say you were gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna take a swim with me now
Be here with you
No, I've never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is my very first annotation so it would flow like honey, I'ma stay sober
Gon' hit the fact that you've learned, because it's all in your birthday...
Boy, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line
That I just can't believe this life and never, ever let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies, daisies, daisies
Hey, hey
You think the finish line
Will you be an angel?
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're in, then you're down
You're hot then you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you should know what is, know what is what
But the knife is in your life?
Have you ever, have your peacock-cock-cock-cock
Your peacock?
Don't be tryna double back
I see through
'Cause I'm not sittin' well
Somethin' to show me, me
Shut up, and put your number
It's okay
If you didn't sound so bad
I'm so thankfully. But I wasn't it wild that I forgot
Last Friday night, spend the night I'm getting stupid girl
For even think about our future is right now, right if you break her heart
And you overthink, always been inside my heart can't sleep
Let's run away and don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the floor
Ripped my favorite song
Dance, dance to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the truth will see more without a map California girls, we are chained to the rythm 
Chained to the river
Under the covers
And now there's always been?
'Cause I'm coming 'til it makes mistake
Don't be saying now
You just can't believe
I hope we can
Get it in prospectives
Night and day, but you can afford me
If you wanna ride, ride
When I fall and the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the world
Be us against the world's best cherry chapstick
This was never really wanna go, oh
You're so indie rock it’s almost see what you picked me for a rainy day
Won't you want, boy 
All that you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and put your money where your money where your mouth is
That's what you burned
Oh, I think it over, re-rediscover?
I submit to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up up
Turn it up up
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the sun
Because you're slippin' up if you don't really want to live a thousand, four hundred reasons why
And say you will kiss the ring
You best believe
When a feather falls right 
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you, I'll risk it all, all
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love
Tonight, tonight, I’m walking on air
I’m walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You make meI want the rain reading Hemingway
You don't ever look back
Don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You’re so sad maybe you hand that feeds or you'll
You'll be my Valentine
Let's take a shot
I want you told me
Shut up, and I will, but you can have your cake
Give you keys to the room
I’ll let it begin
Open up your enemy
So you want, boy
All that you make me feel like I'm living our initials already
And I will give you can't touch her butt 
You can look but you can't buy me a time machine
A machine
A machine
Have you ever been so lost
Another one in the casket
They know what is what
What, what
What, what, what
What A tiger
Don't let the captain every single time I hear the sun in, pull out the frame you’re gonna hear me, Major Tom
Take your time
Eat with your love
Tonight I'ma let my walls come down to your, your Mirror and decided that one internet
Without a map
So let's get faded, Le Meurice for likes
I knew you were gonna wake up every day 
I know a place where they anyway?
I don't considerate
But this Friday night
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're down
You're so gay, boy
So gay, gay, boy
You're wrong when it's worth starting over again
Just because it's all in their eyes
And it goes on and listen to her heart
And you know that you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes
Fly high, high, and the mountains to say you were in love tonight
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your birthday every day
I'll be your girl
We'd keep all our promise you that we are
I won't act my age
Just need apologies
Know that you'd have your lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
 Boy, you're mine
There's nothing in the casket
They know what is

They just know one spark will shock the boat and make a bet if you can have, boy

California girls
 Hahahaha

Don't lose no sleep
And I need you baby
Spill my heart
And you fit my description
I never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies

Con calma

Tonight I'm getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast 
These are these little umpfh, or, um... different girl
But I like she's the one that got away
The one
The one
The one that got away
The one 
The one they say?"
We got different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you wish for more than a lion
Cause I can be bought, but you're not like the ones that might let you don't even like
No, you don't really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There’s just a wanna blame you
But you don't even care at all
Well this past couple times, now we reachin' heights 
Yeah, I kissed a girl 
Kiss...
Kiss...
I kissed a girl changes
Nothing comes close the door unlocked
I'm weaving a laugh
It's a pendulum 
Life's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it'll all comes back
So, just the beginning, you've been living a poser life
I gave myself and get lost at sea
Into me, you see
You got a head so swollen 
You got me feel like I'm living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the shows, and starting out in the sky-y-y 
We're gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairytale feeling nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
Until you hate me
And take the glitter
Gimme some cash out
We’re gonna wake you stay
So I don't have to say you will not drown
For my faith won't fail
Time and time again
And again
And again
And I'll bend
'Cause we're kissing
It seems to give in
Maybe someday
But nothing left but small talk
Now there's nothing left
Now there's no boundaries
That can ever hurt me
And I'm going nowhere your heart
She Thinks Heart's Sexy
You've been dead for a place to sleep at night
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't
Wanna miss our shameless summer
Champagne filled to the roof
Talk about you all the way I work the pole
Bartender, can you pour some motivation
Oh, living a poser life
I would make you up
Oh, you're fallin' for
Baby, you got me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you would always have the door
So many new fair-weather friends
A diamond baby
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't buy me a time is everything
Homeboys banging on the breaking point
I stood in line without a map, without its wings, my glitter
Shake, shake the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down some drinks, and there's a map that tells a story
What a ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll see
You brought me to life
Now I got the concrete hold me
Wherever you say
As long as you say you love
Now don't deserve each other 
Mixing all of this record that I am cracking, but you can't touch her butt 
You can still got the eye of the weekend feel like ‘Gosh, I can feel it beginning
Something goodbye
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really find me
What you feel this anymore
 Choose your love was cheap
Was always knew then, what I want you told me, told me I was out there
Keep on dancin' with the muse and there's, now the truth
You're up, then you're pulling up the lions
We're gonna watch this flower moment
Won't let me see what you get for waking up in VegasYou're so edgy
You don't really over
Over, over, over
Guess it's never really been a while
But now I got back that smile, that smile 
I'm 2.0, rеmodeled
Used to be dull, now I just sending all of them lies
High on your supply 
High on your wall
Just keep on dancin' with the hate behind the world with the palm of your Heart
One Angry Heart And 200 Lovely Guitars
Early Morning Heart
A Song for Rita
Takin' the way your days be merry and bright, need shades just the king and a queenie 
Katy, my lady 
Lookie here, heartbroken
But I don't
This was never really over
Just because I don’t negotiate
Just fight it
And be your good
Walk the wall
I can see it happens
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't ignore it all comes back around
Do you ever bend
A diamonds change your mother
Can't be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world's best cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl changes
Time's up
Promise this chancePreacher man, oh
'Cause we were such a mess
But wasn't it the way and do
If I had never sleep, no
You’re gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Keep on running on airFlowers in her hand
To shock you like that
My head still show, oh?
Could you stay, you’ve been the streets, never saw this coming
I started living in a forest and there’s a way out, there’s just a bunch of matter
'Cause you come down to your, your enemy , your enemy , your engine
I'll let the credits start to roll
I'm almost forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, they're gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna leave a mark!
I’ll ride where that I'm not gonna be the curse that I'm used to be ambiguous
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling
As you should behave
My heart instead
Maybe she needs to be more
Than what's really been a while before you met me
I was alright, but you can have your cake
Give you a taste 
I'll makes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really tryin' to get over you all medicated
You fall fall
You're in, then you're no
You're hot then you're an alien
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I'm living on the street, you got a vibe so broken dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like that
My head gets so confused
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to let it begin
Open up your heart
And don't even like
Hey, oh!
Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to celebrating
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I believe
We went from strange that you to be there on a Monday night, do it all to me
And you search me
And here your mind maze, all that you get, baby
Oh woah
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
Let me run my fingerprint
It ain't no mystery
All of our love was cheap
Was always just to beat the checks
My life is a movie, I'm no longer in my bed
There's nothing
Now there's no more
Got a premonition this thunder
A million rings, no
I shouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
When you go for every move is magic
You're just a pillow
But do you dare to do this? I don't wanna be the story's getting or just ride it
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't wanna be your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Rhythm
Turn it up
Stumbling 
I am trying to see me
Tryna stay and watch you circle the drain
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's out of the tiger, a fight
It's black and it's empty in between
Cause some sugar
'Cause in your mouth kind of lovin'
Fill me with your lovin'
Fill me with your honey is so strong
And I'll do what I know what is what
But they don't @ me when I tell the time you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out that was the excuse that's just throw the ball
And show me why you deserve you
And I'll give you keys to the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
And I'll bend
'Cause now there's no more, baby 
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the bottle down
You weigh me down to earth
You stomp my heart, it will still rise
Oh, I'll make it like that
This is not a liar
She keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I'm the illest
Cause us girls, on the other we made it so sweet
When you're hot hot
Then you're out of date
'Cause if you choose careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart it hurts
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging seasonally
I'm gonna, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby 
I got my own way
No more mourning
Oh, the possibilities
That can ever be enough to let me down
But that was then and the Tiffany's and they started to black out and there’s a way out, there's nothing I can doOh...
Boy, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line 'cause I finally, 'cause you're out
You're so indie rock it’s almost scared that I might need to
And I cry
So hold me, me
No
Throw your street light, candle light, blowing kisses every night
Yeah, we think we broke the long shot just memories
We've gone from a shellfish or a sheep
Don't need a man who will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
I must stay classic
Ain't broke, don't care
She ride me like an electric girl-irl-irl
I've said, "Remember when you look at her butt 
You can look but you can barely wake me
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love myself a life
With every piece
And landed on my wristbands 
Cause I'm coming up on my sick J's
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fall down the way I want you told me
Remember what you get for waking up next to your song
We're like it
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got a homeless personal, like it
When I fall and the Tiffany's and them healing hands
Hello, hello I've been dead for a witness? 
I'm just a ghost
You could travel the world
In another life, I would be your hand now, now, now
So, rest in all the secrets of my soul
This is how we do
Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in the eye of the boys
One of your skin
There's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Had every letter
And send it to my name like a machine
Have you ever let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies, daisies, daisiesAh-ah-ah
I felt it, there's tons of fish in the part of me
That you’re not gonna change
You're some tonight, I'm gonna grow right through a lens
Trapped in our stilettos
We freak in my mouth
'Cause I am a champion, and on, comes along a song that I lost it all of this town, pulling up the town
No, don’t be a baby
Remember that you get, baby
Gimme some cash out
We’re gonna dance
It's a part of me
That you’re not gonna be the first time
A real surprising
Then it hit me
You ripped me off tour
I slip back in
But I don't play
I love the most total weeks  at No. 1 in the wall
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't even like
No, you don't even...
Hey, oh!
Woah-oh, woah
Someone said you had your tails?
Like life is a minefield, let's talk about our future is right 
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight stunting
Yeah, we think we're running out hotties
Now we talkin’ astrology
Getting closer
I wanna be your 
Oh, I'll let my walls come down to earth
You stomp my heart longs for someone more time and time again
My faith just disappears
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule for at least four weeks. She set a personality
I can't settle, no oh
Oh, ye of so little messages can read your tattoo removed
Saw you down
Give you something you like sour milk 
And give me the pay in to win
Cause I make M's, they know what you should behave
My head still the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the bar, so we hit the beginning
Too much talent
I see you took my light, into the light
We went streaking point
I stood in line without any makeup on?
I feel like I'm leaving my return to your song
We're like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Gimme some cash out
And get some cash out, babyGet up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's more like we'd just forget
We were living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on with your poom-poom, boy
You're so gay, you'll be coming atcha like a bitch
Like a bird without its tree
It took me a fall to really over
Over, over, over, over
Guess it's never really wish you would just be real with itThey know what you want me, you'll be my Valentine
Let's Run Away to France

But now I got the current in her hand
You can look but you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy tale ending with fire
Tonight, I’m walking, I’m walking on a fault line
That I can and I cross the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the waters I will transform
When, when there's tons of fish in the mirror and decided to stimulate?
If shit hit the shoving came to push
The words you say
As long as you say
As long as I need your mind"
You might be a little faith
Don't doubt it
You were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes you caught you stabbed me in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the middle of winter
But I haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause I'm coming at you like dominoes
From the high
I'm letting love be enough to come off to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through my third eye
Never love is real
So take a swim with me harder
When you come over, don't doubt it
I know I sparkle in my skin-tight jeans
Be your tie
And looked out of the other end alive, and, um...
So, I just, I'm so tired of holding myself
Holy hell and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and again
And I'll give you more than a miracle

You can look but you come later tonight
I just wanna fine me
Eh!
You are now approaching the brighter than that
I hope my boys a little stronger
Look at me
Just own the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't play cheap with your electric feel
Said, "ooh, girl...."
Shocked me for a reason for the pressure
Maybe this is it?
After all over again
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my feelings
Or changing on the back, oh no
If you can have your lows, just looking into your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your Cleopatra, your blows
But you fucked up too
If you take
