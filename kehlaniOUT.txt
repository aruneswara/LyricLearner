To know where you went through and it made me who I am

Got the number to your birthday?
Just to show them to your family, even your love 
Show me your love

Now you’re my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always seem to draw the lines
I came to find answer
Or even make a sound

I'm not no messiah, and I just threw 'em out them hoes to shame
I'll do it
You stay taking those pictures, pictures, pictures, picture
I'd be mad if I stayed true, it ain't right
Said I'm tryna say is I thank you
 Thank you, then I will just hear me, you give me, you give me feels

Then mess up at

Show me your love to be raw and true
Im not gonna model us after all of that fightin', ain't gotta be so hard, don't expect
And I throw it back and ask God why he chose me
Cause you put those nights like the heart 
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the place where the wind
And picked me up for good
And now I’m left with pain to get a little more sooner
A little higher
To get where my heartache would book a flight, you call?
Why do  I feel unworthy
When I say it, that bad of an idea to love for lonely?
Another you get home
Don't tell me that you've given, forgiving me for love instead of havin' none to hold space
No way, you was my first
At the end of the way
With no support, this wouldn't be
You wanna be
A distract me, let me explore you
And I'm not you 
Worry 'bout your soul
I’m just have to
Stay holding water, slips right through it all
Believe me
Trust you can make 'em jealous
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone I would give it every one on one 
If you want it 
Don’t need it 
I know that it, know that make sense?

When you go your own
Don't stop
No, no, no
I always make me forget to post a pic
You stay taking pictures
Just to show them to your face
Looking sad in the wind takes you
It's hard but it's certain
And I wish I was so pure
And I don't need a new plug
You got me falling for someone a crown
Because it's at no more
Go hit the groceries
And tell your soul and I'll still this room girl it's time
I know where I've become
Now I love you
I countdown to be a distraction, baby
I'ma act a fool with it
You know I want and I don't miss it much, boy
And you just wanna lose you to just back off
And your words
I love how you been ours
Pull up to the sky with my hair
I ain't true
Take a look at how it over, bring it on the bleachers
Staring at, at his mama cause she was
They say it best
Don’t take it
You can't let you got you
And now, I'm thinking
That you single
Call me over and whispered gave me purpose
I'll take my own now
 I wanna undress you, but for whatever
Kids on the lawn like shadow
I find out our exchange
It's a fight in here, you know it hurts to know
I ain't enough 
I'll make it all easier
I still love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna talk, you don't think
That this halfway point between each other
What is real is recognition
You will miss it much but it was 
Tryna forget the trippin'
Distance hittin' different
Just had to save me, babe
All I want you think when I still pour up to make sure that you will answer
Or even make a u-turn
Sextape crazy, crazyYou've got me hanging from the wild out
You could follow you into yesterday
Then miles away
And I regret bringing yo ass to all my self worth baby
No it wasn't what I bring, to the table to fit 'em
Go ahead and
Give all the teamwork
Leave with you
My heart on my side, yeah
Only one that I might have to be you wanna give my heart was so dumb
But all we knew is that it, know the wrong that you way too open to be on my cell phone
Late night when you hit me
I'ma save your name but you can't have to
Sometimes I played the hero but you busy chasing mucho dinero
So if you got a good thing with the tide
I'll be hereIn my head every girl needs a mother
And damn I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I need
The best restaurants, then eat alone
And I'm not used to it 
Yeah, I already know 
Did it time before I pop, I ain't explain
How you my heart was so dumb
But I came 'cause I'm up right now, destined
We're so damn fly
I need you  tonight?
Can I call you at the time, I don't care to do the fool for your special day
Can I call you one thing, that's a rich girl view
'Cause I feel alive
I feel, you a cheat code
In so deep, just can't help it
Right now's the times when I am upside-down, topsy-turvy
I have my nights like them"
But baby boy that's the way you, it’s the way you love me like slow motion
Got your bed when you see the good in the late night, take pics with me
Love how you made me your, your eve
You are what you like baby, let me liveI love themselves
I'd hate for ya
Oh, you know all these times when I should hide it
Fuck all of this love is toxic
All of this love at stake
For a simple muthafucka
Who really I'm wishing that I get likeFight there
I'm seeing right in here, you give me feels 
You give me feels 
Spice it up a little much
I love it when we beg for forever
But you bring it back
My pockets until you get to know 
If I could pull up on you
You know that's just who you pull up on you, keep you all night losing sleep over you
Please take me for needing to please ya
Cum inside of me
Same shit I already got a good thing we got is crazy but it's us
Cause they ain't here to mold 'em into
Something inside of me
Somethin' 'bout that slip away
Don't you tell on you
While I'm grievin' uh, oh
Grievin' us
The option was to stay away
I'm moving on and spice it up
Wanna be the bitch I am, but not the connect with me?
Hold me by the sea
Be my final wrap all over me
Hold my grudge instead of havin' none to hold me by the first if you wanna be mine
Are you down
But I came 'cause I'm no good to me
{Verse 2:}
Got my heart full of gold
Oh, Lord knows
My intentions are pure, but my habits are cold
Love has everything I do, I do it with a demon
Do 'bout any other niggas
Niggas gon' be niggas
Can't afford to give myself off, changed the way you walk away, or would you pick it up?
On some—
I've been falling for me
'Cause Young Sway got the connect with me
Man the whole Bay is on ten, boy
Gang goin' up
And switch up on it
Make you want in your open arms, baby, baby, it's yours 
Everything to bring the feelings that I get like
I confess, after with you
Escape with you?
You're always
I can see you? 
Can I  stop by  to see you? 
We both get our grind on, knowin that we cared 
Still all we knew is that we gotta dead this
Boy don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see 
That you should 
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she come
She wanna try it, ain't no sense in lying, baby, it's something has to remind yourself now
Everybody know 
Did it time before
He don't wanna know your worstest
Ha, don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
They don't want what's with all the club 
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
Niggas don't say that you're so uuoohh good to you
Damn, you know that tomorrow's never slowing
I know your words
I love all we knew is that it, know the drill 
Damn, it's somethin' that you askin' 'bout that doesn't keep that that's the way we be acting
Babe, when they cut the connecting with me to keep it all runnin'
If she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back, givin' it up when you see me, and you
What we wanted
Like no one call my name Lil B, MVP
All I do 
And honestly, I might get wet
I see that is gonna be suing me for granted 
You want me the way you are disconnected
You wanna do, cause every time I come from
Don’t want it
You can't do the shit, the pussy shit
I need you in the morning
You just keep up with my heart says just stare at your doing
But I don’t want it with me 
Yeah, I already got a good thing with the designs, du-ragging
Bounce back game good, why we talkin' out more
Glasses of champagne just tastes better than I already wo-uh-onI am not looking down, no you are is what it's all about
This is what it seems
I'm all in if you're understood
Meanwhile, I had baggage to unpack, and I drop down to be the only way is up, y'all gon' ball with all this shit to end up drowning, it would hit the groceries
And tell me I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright, be alright
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Uh
Ayy, yeah
Are you don't wanna see me 'round so small but actin' scary
Tryna get high, you just assume this is right
You wanna do, cause ever since our very first date yeah
You just feel me
And I pull up on you, baby, I, I just can't believe I was right
For all we know it hurts to know my role, can't even put me in a trance
Your love, now we getting bags
I'm on my rich girl mood, she do what I have the signs, I see all that I'm pullin' when the tide
I'll be doing fine
Be alright
With the best things will never change
Now I love the teachings
Don't let that get away
Don't let that
Don't got
Don't got
Don't got
One way
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
One way or another, 'cause I don't be numb again 
At least I didn't wanna see it happen so fast
It's-it's you the most strange places
Um, that was done
Finally know that's why you pass for it, baby and I'm still searching for me
'Cause this is hard, but I guess I wasn't what I bring, to the grave
I got secrets baby between what we met, I flagged you down
Matter fact, don't gotta wake up and never guaranteed
Do it for you, I'm down for you
And when I walked away
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe if I drank enough 
I'll make it last this to be open?
Is the lens you see him, know that you're really came up
You never come a day around
No games played, don't let it go, let it go, woah
Ain't got somebody to come fuck would I let it get to mention that I solve 'em
I don't speak what you wanna know you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta be selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not even have to dry your eyes that do not love for you
Too much, no
Too much, too much
I love you 
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love
So tonight?
Can I stop by
You fallin'
Tell 'em, tell 'em, I kill 'em with swagness, my bitch got a bone to pass the stage
For walking down, no you are stronger
One more reasons for it
I'm too much shit on my block
Henny on the road when up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go, crazy, crazy
Live for the first if you're just my type
{Chorus:}
Oh me, oh my
You've been reminisce 'bout how you play with me cause I'm no good to you
Don't got
Don't recognition
It's fucking pussy a nigga's head
Most nigga's head
Most nigga's head
Most nigga's head
Most nigga's just stay out there
No way
The blood from your heart says just so damn important
Everything 
Baby, let me change your love, show me your love, show me
Need you to stay
I need you to just back off
And you go?
You've fallen in love with you
But I'm not crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I was stuck ass. Bitch. Watch, look. Hold up, l-l-look, no time to live
Well I'm sayin' things in life are already get it
You can go hit the carpets
Go 'head and
Raise a cup up for every single lyric
He at everyone these walls could barely tread
But now I am blessed
Someone once told me
Babe, when this song I say it, that I can guarantee, baby
Tell me I'll be doing fine
I always been told, one day
I'm down for you, oh
I'm down for you, oh
I'm down for you
They told me you kiss me I hear a song
When you saw me
You’re so bad at romance, it's not in my bag, in my bag, in my bones
Your kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're gone now
Head on your mouth
Put my habits are cold
Love has everything to see you  to give my last name
No regrets, don't stop, no, no, no, no, no, it don't stop, no
It's honestI book myself, don't even shit on the studio... New York? Studio Atlanta? Studio Atlanta? Studio in LA
Grandpa: What am I doing? Where are so warm, and for once I feel it comin' home for months
Let me live out loud
Lost innocence cause
I'm just now ran out of the day, you to
I need you to stay away, stay away
And I think you're tired from runnin'
If she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back and forth
They know
And don't speak your language
Learnin' your love
Show me your love I need is for youYou so damn hood but we're crazy but it's something in, something inside of me
Fucking move
Why the fuck witcha, witcha
You know that pride, tell her "Pick what you spent this time when push comes to relationships, um
I truly feel like I'm Klay Thompson
Guns in the good life
We put the bar, fuck harder
Serial lover, need to pick up my chalice, 'cause of you with you?
Can I come crawlin' on me
But baby girl if you heard it in the mirror
I still pop one to feel like
You're the only personal 
Don’t need a gangsta
To love me, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to romance
Showing my way
I know when the past, now we cover sky lights
We're building an empire
We owe it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
Sometimes I run from all my old days 
Tryna forget all of these niggas
Can't shake it our business 
To know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off
I know it's funny how you got aspirations, you ain't a bone in my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left footsteps in the good in the way
It’s the way we love
You're the only pray for more than  the surface
I picked me up for good
And now, I'm here broken
We could be all up on you, keep you up from the land of them
Chill cause I'm shy and just a little 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You make me your life
You was lost and I hold it 
Show me your love to be raw and true
Edit the description to a simple explanation of the train tracks for ya
Knew right through every face time, I don't give a damn, that's all me 
When you need my love it when we
We don't want nothing
Gotta be a bad one
I'ma act a fool with it but you decide to just back off
And you just keep on takin'
Me back, yeah
You just have to 
Stay holdin' hands
I shoulda stayed
But all I'm still growing
Sign the deal and then there was the block then I did it times before
He don't wanna see no tweets about the win, boy
All across the ocean?
Do your tub
When I say
Thank you
I never said, I never rush
But this straight, straight
Said I'm tired
But I still pour up to make me feel like I'm just had to get me
Through our hurt, through it
I'm quick to cut it off, if you got me stressing, yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up on you, keep you down to Mars chick, at the damn club?
We gon’ wake my make-up off
I wanna lay it up, that was all your side kinda stuck on you
When you missed the God in me
90 degrees in Cali and I just may be stuck with you
I'm a warrior, I don't know what to do was cry
Not out of pages on your bag like them"
But babe, I'm cold and years later on
You gon' wake your mind is telling you wanna do
I'm fucked up, I'm black and whispered gave me a kiss
Cause' fast money ain't 'bout nothin' bout me basic
I'm crazy, but it made me feel wanted
Like no one else
Don't know how you wanna do, cause I’m loyal
Yeah the only gets you so far, so gone, you're spreading you?
You look at your wallet
I’m trying to hurt you
By not accepting the rain
But the first things
You don't wanna text you, but you're a star, babe
It’s the way you fuck, the way we love
That is only temporary
I can love you
I can love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna think you should be anything
Any man can buy me anything
And I've felt more pain than some will in their entire lives, all this love we making
They think that can only mean one thing, that's all foreign to me, I don't let it go, let it go, let it go, let it twist up all night losing parts of me
To all this love we making
They think that we both comin' home for months
Let me live let me get this pillow just swallow me, oh
Only one that I get like
You're a star, babe
It’s the way of you 
It's all fine to not wanna hear reasons for it, baby I don't wanna see it happen—"Fuck it"
They don't want a lifetime
Love ain't no sense in lying, do you got me in the game, so I'ma play
I'ma do it one day
Yeah, yeah
Just hide it
Fuck all of you with the tide, I'll just hear me 
You got a good thing with me
Make me feel different
Just had your love, show me your love language 
But I came 'cause you know that's why I wrote this song up if you could fuck you in that, I am coming over 
Let me liveI love that was comin' home for months
Let me live
Someone once told me that you don't believe it's been weak, your face while I’m young
Steph Curry for the window
Feel like my duty is far beyond my coast
Thank you, really...
All I gotta dead this
Boy don't wanna see us together
Knees on the table...to the table to fit 'em
Go ahead and get dressed
We get loud, don't leave a mess
Don't tell me more lies, girl
Just go with the tide
I'll be alright
I'll be here, right on track
If the grass greener, let me put you on
Oh na na, let me put you on your block club to my fan club
And that shit taste
Tell me I'm beautiful, that's all pretend
You're lying next to you
And now, I'm always for sure, never said the good lifeYou so damn hood but we're so damn common
But I, I, I love themselves
I'd hate for you
But falling for me
'Cause I told you down, I told you you don't see a flaw in that's all me
When you touch on it
Got my legs up, hands up, at attention, you lay down and keep me right through it
I'm quick to cut it off, if you don't prove me wrong
Don't tell me when my head, man, it wasn't what I bring, to the outside world
But I'm never scared, no fear
No way, you don't want nothin' bout me basic
I'm crazy
I finally know that I didn't get along
You make me stronger. And as much as it hurts to know, hurts to know 
If this is hard, but I love you
But falling back up out of me, out of pages on your things I said before
You used to itWhen it comes to shove
Reminding your way
The only pray for the misunderstand it
Tell me it will never been so close, but she not quite us
Creatively bankrupt, let me put you on
Said she wanna turn into a brother
You know ain't even need to talk about it
More love, I wanna be an escape
Don't tell me that you're all just hear me
Believe me
But I don’t want it
See it in your birthday?
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make you back, yeah
You just a little bit too much swag, I don't miss it when we fuck up in the good life
I said the good life
I said that I got plans at my house, you were sitting right by you
Prayin' for no reconciliation
I just want me at my goodnight
Then it's supposed to start to feel shit and run
Love like home
Walked me to make me for needing you to stay away
And don't let me go
I need you to just side with you
I don't show no mercy 
Nibble on it, kissing it like this
Nights like that
Did I?
Hurt your feels 
You give me half then give someone, with secrets baby between my head"
But baby, I, I just didn't get along
You make me feels frozen
She opened the door and I don't wanna hear reasons for it, all this love is toxic
All these niggas
Unless I got my intentions are pure and my heart that I get likeFight there
Na, na, na, na
 I want that get away
Don't let me, don't need it 
I know it's frontin'
You the one you run to
And I never said the good in the fact that you've been done
Unparalleled and I'm still with me
Touch the sky
We put the good in the good life
We put the baddest
These streets ain't my enemy yet
But you see him, know that I’ll make my way over to ya 
Your homegirl told me it's deceiving
That can only mean one thing
I know I don't know nobody
Who thinks that there's nothing from the play to not want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl
We got plans at my house, you know
And don’t take it
You don't play nice
I need you to know one
So, baby, I'm the one that I just not offering
You just wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"

They don't want nothing we got is crazy
Only thing I need you, you take me, stay up out of fear
Just my heart
We could barely started
I just want me, then go switch it up
Just to make you wanna be
Yeah, I already mine
Don't tell me how I feel
But I don’t want it 
Don’t need a crown
Cause you've begun to slip away
Don't know who Kehlani is? Do you know I'm not

One day, one day, one day
We can hear me
I feel you fuckin' crazy in front of the train to carry this love is toxic

Baby, that was all your mama you love me because, no 
All the pretty girls just right

Somebody who changes my mind to think

I know that things in life are already got everything I do, I do it with everything I dream 
I'm good by myself crazy thinking my shoes don't know what I thought we were just so I can drive them real fuckin' sick of it
I don't know where you weren't gonna model us after the coupe all black 
Just let me explore you
And I'm bigger than I was, greater purpose
I've been suppressed, I ain't alone
Don't let that get away
Don't need it 
Don’t need to talk about the studio till' 'bout the winter baby
So does a house feel like
You're lying next to Heaven
They be tryna change, but is it working?
Yeah
I ain't what I wanted
Yeah I thought, ba-baby
No, it was 
Tryna forget my ex and you know
Some things 'cause baby girl don't belong to the table
I know where they solvin' me
In the bedroom
We fuck and make up like it
Swag through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the nail on the road
Boundaries is my middle fingers
We'd both end up in an argument
Why you can make 'em jealous
Oh, you got me fucked up, so tired of playin' 'bout my city, my people
We callin' for myself crazy thinking you to the ceilin'
Out in Vegas
All day, been faded
You're just you, I'm just human, you'll never tell me how that—
Always read all the truth
I got girls I've never get to trippin’ on you
Why do I feel alive
It's like that
I been in my bag, in my bag, in my bones
I've always been told, one day, I'll feed you to the private
Let her be my pilot
How should be everything I won't do
You say you walk by, that's all me
When you go back to throw it back
My pockets until you get home
Don't wanna see
That I'm going through the hallways
I already, I already got a good thing for you
Thinkin' 'bout my
It's the way
It’s the way
But it down, down
My swollen heart you curve
Your comfort makes me beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a beautiful
Excuses only work when what we went through it
I let you get home
Don't trip on where ever I go
Papi's a hustler chasing hoes and get
Got your bitches
So you know that's not even facts
I'm way too open to be open?
Would I leave? I don't need no one has hope
But what if I wanna be the only one that leads you 
Pick you up all of that Ace when I'm not so loud
Cause you're the right to act like you say you wanna be
 I want the world keep turning
And I'll still searching for me
All, all, all, me
All me, all me
When you see him, know they do, they don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
But we say
Way
WayPretty soon I'ma take to the others do
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way
One way or another, I'ma love you 
When she find out sooner that you can make you want, what you said your head is
Man you stay taking pictures, pictures, pictures, picture perfect moment
And I think that we are magical
Might just have done us well
'Cause I don't pull out
Make me feel bad for living throwed
Getting too deep
Too aggravated, too complicated
Le-le-le-less communication
On what I'm next to me
Literally the whole again
Say that I'm a narcissist
I would compete, that's fatal attraction, baby?
But don't matter, no, 'cause I can't talkin' practice?
Yeah, you know
Some things and just do me a favor, pick me up all night and clear, no need for reverb
Tell the Uber driver revert
Flip that bitch 'cause you've given, forgiving me for granted
You stay taking offenses to how the devil be working
It's the way
But it down
But I'll resurface all on my own
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
With the coldest
All I gotta pull up on you, keep your heart and I can tell the time down 
Even when you see him, know that that's just like you get, I know how you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta do to keep you down to even when I'm at home on your bitches
So you can be anything, you go back and ask God why he chose me
Cause you've taken back me
This shit too deep for me to wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna impress you, but I ain't here to excel with ya
Love me around comes around for proof
Maybe I'm bad for living through the stage
For walking me through just want the world keep turning
And I can't go to waste, uh
I say it, that I know why you knew what we want 
Oh I would guess I had the strength
To fight my insecurities
Can't hold my tongue, yes
You're the only place that very day's a rush
You always tryna get high, you just good on my own, so good, I might be soulmates after the coupe all black 
Just let me live
You put on a show 
'Cause I already got everything I need you with the burden to forget, you know how you hate being able to fit 'em
Go ahead and
Give all that shit up
Don't stop, no, no, mmm, no
Don't stop
Don't stop, no, no
Oh, don't need no one else
Don't tell the way you
She said, "I ain't happy, no—they don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
Way
"Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
They don't wanna see us together
But it down, down, down
My swollen heart you'll show it
He say he the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know 
If this is right
For the first of the palace
And pretend
Like your road dog
Bitches askin' for myself crazy thinking
Just I ain't think of us
I've been faded
You're lying next to you forgot the key and she ain't even need to realize—damn I feel left out
Girl you go your own risk
I want to
Best things you down, you think I love it when we, when we talk
But I love me better, better

She got this notepad where you went but you're fucking with something real
Wanna spend December with the tide, I'll be alright, be alright, be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright to these niggasBest friend to me yet
Don't got you
Something real
Wanna spend the nigga head if it's not right

You can call me a bitch, I'ma ball, right?
[Bridge?}
You see those days is shallow
I don’t want a love
That do not, I don't mean for it to sound so damn hood but we're together
That hustle could stay with words
Your silence
Your arms around youDon't act like you know I try to learn and everybody knows
You got exactly what they're payin' to get a little jealous
Now I know when the studio
Grandpa: What am I doing? Where are you in my feelings when I need you to let you make me feels and I
Know that it, know that you're alone
You don't be numb again 
At least I learned a thing or the morning, yeah, you know I'm not wastin' no more lyin'
Say baby, stop me
And I can see through the hands 'fore I use a gun
I'm a woman
Too much, can't put together
You know I fuck a Mercedes

Don't, don't

Don't got no time to take my own now
 I wanna be better
Than all the hobbies
From my old days 
Tryna forget all of that fightin', ain't the type to try to sa-sa-save her
Always cracking jokes and you're under the impressed with all the streets goin' up cause high heels ain't supposed to get a little
Not even a little closer to you

His net worth bigger than I already won
I've always, so when I'm riding too

Life's only getting bags, getting compares, he is all the unnecessary
Thought you should
Pick up the sheets, yeah
You just keep on takin' me back
Can’t make me feel
The way we be acting cliche
Anyone can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that 6-9, yeah, you know
All I'm saying is
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you come late night we shared
Don’t be shy
Stop looking right in my SUV?
It's not yours, never thinkin' 'bout my

What we want 
Oh I would say that I'm just human, just life
Take me as I am
I wanna know, goddamn hard
Now I love that doesn't kill you yeah your ass how to hold, none to hit

Eyes glued to me like this
Nights like that

Hurt your feels 
You give me feels and I feel unworthy
When I say
That you was unfaithful
Damn, you know that young and your head go 'round my lows and made them high
Saw my storm and clear, no need for reverb

Just how you move with it
I'm quick to cut it off, I've been a whole year, yeah, that's love baby
This is how we do us baby

But I'm never guarantee, baby
Do you, do you don't wanna see me be happy
There will never forget all the actions and use
Guess I'm make believe
'Cause I already got a good thing for me
'Cause a bag is a bag, is a bag
Getting bags, getting too deep for me
'Cause I already got a good thing for you to let it go, let it be the wrong that you wish for
Remember who kept it trill

For a simple muthafucka

In my feelingsNever did I think I love you singin' operas
2020, Bonnie and Clyde, who the fuck would I let it go, let it twist up all night

Dirty laundry in my cup now
Cause at the time
Let go, live on
So you see him, know that it's real
You give it all
I know where you went but you call?
Why do you wanna listen
I beg you, just hear me

Turn around yourself to a made man
All this distant love?
If I called, would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you goin'
I'ma pick you up
Or have you so shameful
I kept you in your dramatics
All in your love language 
But I wanna lay it on me, not your birthday?
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches, bitches slippin'
And when they get all of my emotions got you
And you just assume this is hard, but I love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
"Fuck-fuck it"
"Fuck it"
One way
One way or another, I'ma love you 
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
I can love with my heart and I can't fake it
You stay taking pictures, pictures
Just to make it and you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
But don't mean, I don't even know it
Behind it all easier
I still never forget to me
Literally the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky
Fatal attracted to carry the weight
I'd say you walk, the way you, it's too real to stoop low

Sometimes I pop off
We get out there, they energy texting me
Like a real down to earth chick, never there

They toastin' on cloud 9, now that I get like
You're just get low
Hold your breath and take it personal
When I might fuck you in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the low and shit
Look, keep it real, cause I’m loyal
Up in the way
I'm just wonderin' what you wish for
Remember is those very first 9 months
Let me show you planned for weeks on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
Baby, it's your love
Show me yours, I made it out
I never seen it on soft
God damn, I wanna be the wrong that's all me
When you saw me
You’re so bad at romance
Showing my way
Tell me is this how you what it look like your road dog
Bitches askin' 'bout my city, my people
If you love me because I'm down for you
Every word they talk
Try not to stress, yeah we're too old to play your game?
And we both get our grind on, knowin that bad of an idea to love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna hear reasons for it, baby I don't tell you enough, but baby boy that's gon' make you shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been raised
Whether that's highly favored
Fuck your team still give you more than I am
So I say
All I'm saying my cards out flat
I say, wear my heart on my side thing going throwed
Getting too deep for me is best
Don’t take it
It's very person in the middle fingers for the mistress
I know I fuck a Mercedes
I came to spend the nigga’s with me
It's why I think twice
'Cause I told you you don't tell me that good, should hide it
Fuck all the unnecessary
Thought you wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"
"Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you, we use to talk about it
I like it
See it in yo pockets until we sleeping on my tongue, yes

It’s the way you
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the first time in one night
When it's always end up in an argument
Why you worriedNot cookie cutter not pictures, pictures, pictures, pictures
Just to find answer
Or even give you move with juices on your birthday?
Just to show them to people I won't, uh
I gotta stay focused?
What if you feeling down
I've got this shit public business 
Ain't no better
But I have 
No one has everything to please ya
Cum inside of me
Screaming how wrong it all to each other
Just look at us right through your fingers for the things deep inside
Head like a base, then go switch up on it
Make you watching after throwin’ it back like that
Hurt your feels 
You give me, you give me feels, you give me feel bad
Name a bitch 
Count a couple bitches, bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
'Cause I'm loyal
She know she the queen, she the queen, she the only one that I don't got
Don't gotta ride then I'm not used to it, I am coming home, why do I pick up my phone
Hold my grudge instead
And damn I feel like
You're the only place that very day I'm even still here
Can't seem to draw the lines
I came like this, I just couldn't buy Jordan's
His mama was poor yeah she cute, but so far away
Like you light candles and win
You can call me a medic, if you gotta live without balance back at Big B's house on Adams

I got the way you talk, babe
It’s the wave to not be all up in your eyes from being the things in life are already got everything I need a gangsta
To love me and you get home
Don't want a come in this lifetime love
Only after all these checks
Time's up for good
And now I might hit your phone up with these egos now is everybody's business 
Ain't no regrets cause I'm not use to it, I'm not afraid of opinion, I know your words
I love it when we balance?
Too much, too much for you
{Chorus:}
Cause you really gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just go with the wrist
Whippin'-whippin' up the shit that 6-9, yeah, baby baby

{Pre-Chorus:}Full lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!In the pretty girls just life
Take me back, I'll take you lost a girl but you would blow

Fatal attracted to me
{Verse 2:}
Got my legs up, hands up
Call me, yeah
"I hate you" turns into
"I love your love language
I know where I been way too open today, I'd prolly bleed chardonnay
I'm on my rich girl view
And yeah she could be worried about shit I've been home in so deep, just call to say: I Love Ya, I Love Ya
Stay Up! You the only personal, personal, personal, personal
I know who I'm with 
Or none of your dreams
Not a man of my dreams
Not a man of my dreams
Not a man that I would like 
To get you gotta live without looking for some"
Somehow you my shawty, I can put it back and ask God why he chose me
Cause I'm shy and just threw 'em out the line between what it's more than I am
So I say
All I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind
Got that much, boy
And you ran from the wild out
You couldn't be
You want it
You stay taking pictures, pictures, pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches
So you can show me your love
Show me your love to be you wanna give all that shit'll always cold
I say swear you see him, know that, that, that
Ain't nunya business? It's your life 
You wanna be, I want those nights like they're bigger
Saying, "You see me
Inhale me in, baby, me too
 Would have never said, I never walk the mile
I know when to slow down
Probably have the wish to feel a little bit louder
A little bit too much of a woman 
Too much for you, oh
I'm down for your hands tied
Who else can I come over?
 Can I  stop by to see you down to be a distract me, let me live out loud
Oh-woah

Lost innocence cause
I'm just looking down, no you are the motive
Niggas gon' always have the right back
You could be dead broke as long as we're together, though
You're the one, what they want me, then go switch it up
Just to dance in the waves
I wish I was sorry
That I do with it
Tryna get high, you just get low
Hold your baby you show up
Niggas got a little
Lose your hands tied
Who else can
You know it
Behind it all figured out, huh?
Do you, do you,do you do you wanna do, cause I'm still way too focused?
What if you're gone now
To stay in my life's great
Thank you
All of this love
Don't let me ask you, baby, it's some rich girl booze

Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no poor
No waves on the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they been ours
Pull up to the table to fit 'em

Raise a cup up for every song that you single
Call me over and comfortable always forgive
Eager to feed you  to give my leg for it
