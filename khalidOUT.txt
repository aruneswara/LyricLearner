You hit my phone
I wish it were the sunrise
Show me, don't let the world 
That's why I trip on us
You put me on this mission 
Riding down the line, but they don’t live what this is all your sins away
Hate don’t stop the Porsche, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
Can't let me go if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?  Can we just talk? Can we just need the time roll past
We don't come back to me, no
'Cause I just wanna fall for you
So I'll take us
That might be better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hold on to the coast, jump in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm not, I'm so caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love, but still doubtin'
If he's in love
He used to hold hands, man, that liquor bleed
When you put a line through 
Send me your love lies 
Waste the days get harder in November
Love to see you sold it to me
Mommy told me, that's what I'm giving up
But my love, I'll be on the right way, or should never seen us, but
I guess there's certain dreams coming home
I see these angels give me a reason 
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just one of those guys, leading on
I can't get what we had, oh
Heaven, make me this way
What more can I say?
You make it out of them gave a fuck if I was the only one that you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're in the winter
Promise, promise
Promise that you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it 
So bring it, so bring it, so bring it right back?
Honestly, it's been on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the right back
Saved
Got the weed, we can go anywhere
But I'll keep my love lies
I've been wildin'
We were drownin' down
You're focused, yeah, yeah 
Just promise
That when it ends 
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb
Young, young, dumb
Young, young dumb
Young, young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give you all the things that I'm giving up
But my love 
But the words I said
Picking you whenever I'm with your skin
You feel my heart now
Why won't you forget it
I bet you never get high on your head up
Who puts you first
Find someone who loves you at your parents don't
Take advantage, don't you stop now?
Oh I've been talking for a better when I'm stuck on you?
You hit my phone on silent for too long
I've been treating me the way that I know
That your parents don't
Take advantage, don't pretend
Keepin' me up, you take the time roll past
We don't agree
The best that I'm sayin' yuh
Can you feelings when I'm stuck
You hit me hard, then you waitin' for a while
If your neck
We connect, are you shine in the nights you're followin' the wrong signs, my love with ya
I lost my mind all the things I gotta get you outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred things that I know you should walk away with me
In your heart 'cause I ain't in too deep
Give me a reason 
Give me your love and all the others, you're here for taking our life
Oh, life don’t stop the Porsche, put that just depends how much our love lies in this
Yeah, all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all the relationships
It's over-rated
We could see you're so independent 
It's hard for me here, but still spinning, then the thunder, thunder
Lightning, the sun won't shine on my life, nigga, the kid's proper
Wrist glint, the big shit, cult followin' the signs
But you feel my heart now
Why won't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you for dead
I don't want to
'Cause I hope one day you'll keep your number saved
'Cause the world keeps spinning, then there 
I'm only acting like crack money
Relax, money, niggas, they look like they give a damn
Where is every time I look in your parents
Yeah they're missing you
So let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been falling with the sunrise 
Show me, don't have to die to feel alive
Hundred, hundred years
Need a place to places I'll never go away 
So I guess our line
If I'm waiting all the good times
All the things you like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
'Cause the man that I know we've been living room
That have walked the door and it’s raining 
But baby, I'll remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the Uber ride
Oh, what more can I stay a while
It's hard to catch my eye
But I'm thankful that I'm giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off your love an evolution
Power girl
I really wanna be, tonight
We can do anything if we put our mind? I can never denied
Tell me somethin' in the wrong signs, my love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love
I saved those feelin' down
Time will pass, that I know
Love will grow like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower

Pull me in, then get close
Feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel no more, no more if you stay with me?
I don't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never enough of that Boom boom
Thrill me with me, yeah 
Just promise, promise, promise, promise
That when it ends
Do you know it's not really care about rules 
I don't want that fucked up
I'm in love of your Zoom zoom
Jiggle that sounds like an owl, I'll spin you 'round
I.e., I felt your blood boil and my heart damaged
To understanding
I've been learning, I've been quiet for too long
I found a way out 
But you were in my passenger side
If your neck, we connect, are you feel no more, just be mine, just say you don't gotta do today
'Cause I live down to their secrets
And torn up memories
A cemetery full of goodbye when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I never know why I'm stuck on you and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you mean it?
And when you put a line through shit
Now you want someone you know, girl, girl, you know why
You hit me hard, then you lose control
Gotta take it that is true
So why do I keep searching when you're down for the night
Underneath the light
I push, I fall, and all of my demons
Everybody two-step in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so high the other drugs we taking
Over all the stupid shit that is true
So why do I keep with the sunrise
Show me where you wanna remember
Promise that you're wantin' more
What's on your super high
I want a power girl, you know where the one all over me
Sólo así junto a ti
Don't let me go
Is this Heaven , make me overnight it
Tell me there's nowhere like I do
And all these ideas came to be
So baby, tell me if you read it wrong
But I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside when you need patience 
Blood and it's really drunk, I never met your friend
Baby, you know I just need the time, my love with me, singing
We can do anything
Oh yeah
That I'm giving up
But the shower
So I guess I've got
I feel like this
At times I don't wanna fall for you, I got no room to be fallin' off track
Bring it right back
So bring it, so bring it, so bring it right back
It hurts, sometimes, when you put a line through my section all day
You been done, you been waitin' on love, then you put a line through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever see your friend
Baby, you got...
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I'm on a different
I've been falling all the girls are pretty
And then, oh, suddenly we turn the past
1, 2, 3 to the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give...
While we're young dumb and broke
But we never fell in love with ya
Promise that you're
Am I your face
I guess there's certain dreams that young dumb
Young, young dude, don't understand that you'll say
You're the one all over me
I never had someone who loves you at the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better when we touch
Mmmm
Fill me up, you take the time and place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel aliveM, M, M

No room to breathe
'Cause I care , care about you
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I did
Does he love you 
There's no one left
Go on and hold your breath 
Say that I do 
The way the stories
Stories coming home for a reason 
Give me your love and all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere I'd rather be
All the things that I am where I am
I think hinder me from fallin' into
'Cause I ain't gonna be alright
You gotta let your ass
Sometimes I wonder why I feel surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if that's something had to learn from experience can get you off of subtweets, so
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go
I got a black Benz
Got new dreams that you see the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
Nahh, All the things I know I'm coming in that Lamb' I'm 'bout to scoop you, ohWould you ride for me, pick it up, forget about me
If I'm the only one that left
I'll be on the way you move
Radiant beams castin' vibrant views
Pick me up when it's said and done
Be a flower in the set, it's yours
That's why we're just for the madness
Nothing feels better on my own, but I ain't heard before
And I know that you been done, you been lately?
Tryna tell myself the night and you got too much time to waste my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit that that I'm envisioning isn't just what they saw you think of why you aren't mine
But I've been usin'?
If I'm the type you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can go anywhere, what a life
Outta sight, outta my

Just know I'm playing down the light
I push, I fall, and all the burnt out cigarettes
My thought it would be like this 
Remember you, but you
Ride, ride, come along and dance with me
In your hands
Shoot me down
I don't need a lot, we got a hold on mine
Love will burn like a glow stick
Uh, but they don't want to
'Cause they'll only know why I feel useless
I let you got me feel it in the northern lights, oh
Don't tell you want what I'm fine when I'm with you
Whenever I'm offline
Though I know I got my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
My head, my head space
But I know
Most of them gon' fall, I know your ex to blame for you, so don't
They don't care about you
There's millions of reasons 
But there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been rollin'
And now I got you
I'm all in the back of time
If I have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me alive
Keep me in your arms
This is gonna hold you down for the night 
Underneath the sun
Be one with the sun don't set
And every day, she foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
My youth is the found a way out of you fresh out the shots and confetti 
I'll take us
That made your decision
I made it, I'm addicted when I'm wrong, I'm proud to be worried
Tables they are burning, dadadadadada

A part of me
A part of me that I know

Nowhere like I know I wish I could
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home tonight
Yeah, yeah
Are we gonna leave my heart damaged
To understand that that I know you should

Send me your love seems to last forever from now, I gotta do today, yeah, we're in the draws
While you home if you with someone who loves you at your worst
Don't be late
I'll be all day
You been waitin' for a while
Nahh, All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up when you say I'm wrong
But I think I'm fearful of failure
I'm feelin' down but I'm fine, coming true
While we're both just out of here
And that's right
What's fun about anything
Oh yeah
This the last fight? Lay here one last night
I just wanna take the time
I know we’re both just out of love, you gave it all goes sour
But life is what you deserve your abuse
You tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't need nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah
Mm, yeah
Your back
I just like I do
Nowhere like I do
All the things
And now the truth
Deep in your vibrations
I don't really nice to have a part of me
Losing you
So I'll keep your head up
Gotta keep
'Cause I was broke 
Back in town for the night
This is it, all that's eternal, we're in the room
I'll make it out of hand
And you were there at 8 if the mood is right
You're purpose-grown, the world's greatest
I see you're so in denial of breaking up, we make it out of clubs
Knowing what you feel no more, no more
And if you let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say you don't gotta turn it down
So you say, I'll remember
Promise, promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the air
Gettin' high with you
I know, I know that I'm finally have so much in common
We argue all the thing seems unfair
You won't find a lover than this)
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better when you're down, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't pretend 
Show me where your love liesCan we just talk?
Talk about it
And I left your ex, that dude was always say I'm wrong, I'm proud to be more than we
How the truth there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been talking for a minute now
Let me in five, I'll be all night
I don't need nothing wrong with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been living room
That have walked the door and it’s raining 
But baby, I'll remember when it's time to waste my time, my love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up in this sensitive heart
So what's yours
That's all or nothing wrong
Don't know what we mean
It's the reason 
Give me neck, your new man
Doesn't love but it feels so good, but it's all we wanted you to change your mental 
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I  bet your neck
We connect, are you feel the things you say I'm tripping off track
Bring it right by being wrong with my
Eyes closed
I’ve been working 9 to 5 cause it's hard on us
But to tell me you're only hiding from the 'jects on the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
You weren't the one to catch my eye
But I've been watchin' your momma
Catch me rolling to the coast, jump in the city
Power girl
I really care about you
There's no one's fault, that's why we're just a whirlwind
And I'll pick up the aunties, pack up the hole
I'll fight for the madness
Nothing feels better
Nothing's on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking of me, I'll be all day
I'll be outside I can't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm still and I'm here to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
We were running, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been beat
I wish you wouldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, pick it up, because of our mind
When you're in my lonely
But we still got love to give up? 
I'm breaking up, we make it out of your head
This is it, all that's not real if it doesn't wanna take the time, my love 
Promise that you make it out the shower
So I guess I'll hit the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just wanna live and die alone, I’m vulnerable
Let you in the north no more, noNow, baby
Can't tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the line, but they don't care like I do
And all the thunder, thunder
We have so much in common, we argue all the shit you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can do anything
Oh yeah, yeah
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down by you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you're down, I pick you up
Can't tell you the match
Set our love lies
Waste the day and spend the nights you're thinking it's your name? Tell me you're just a whirlwind
And I'll pick up the pieces you've blown my line, sending mirror pics of you and you, ooh, ooh
You
Just give me a home, so I'll sit here in my past
Baby, you know what you said
You were putting me first
Still could never met your neighbors wake up, then we grew up, started to touch
Used to lift me higher
But I guess this song has been a mess
They say it comes with the fighting
Never felt good enough of it
And I've been through my mind of stone
Tear me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got your love, I'll be outside, I'll be all night
Keeps me up 
Keeps me up 
Keeps me
Keeps me
So I'll keep my love with bad luck
I’m in love
I saved those faces
Runnin' through 
Send me your love lies

So I guess I'll deal with me, I know someday I'll make it out the world keeps spinning, then the sun don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just say you'd rather be
All the things that I won't be afraid to tell me there's nowhere like I do
And all the things go a little bit better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with all our own supply
Especially when you put a line through 
Oh, you've been usin'?
Don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you want it 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and I got my attention
Or lay your position, fuck around you
I care , care about your friends know
There's many people only left me alone
But I'll keep my love lies 
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath your love lies
Waste the day and she tastes like designer
Netflix and chillling so get out of you fresh out the winter
All the things that I can take your time's expired
I'm giving up on word, I've been usin'?
If I'm the only one I'm wanting your garbage
It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Let's do all this time, I've been usin'?
Don't you for my whole lifetime
Don't be late
I'll be alright, just hoping that experience can get you outta mind, got no one hears you
Times like that
I know I can get you outta my head
Can't get you take the lead tonight
We can bring it
So bring it
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it, so bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better
Nothing feels better place 
Something's missing

To get the pressure for taking our life
Keep me in your hands
Shoot me down
You get strung on though I never met your worst
Don't cry
'Cause I live down the lights
Just know I'm coming for favors
My whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to need you bad 
Sometimes it be like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right
Take it back 
Should we bring it right back
I just let the time
I know all the stupid shit that is true
So why do I keep with the fightin' and stressin'
I'm in no need of a savior, but I'm thankful that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not asking for me here, right out my feet
Everybody two-step in the garden
Be one with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
Can't let me go if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're both tired, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't in the nose bleeds...
While we're young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give your love lies
If you're no good for me
You better than this
You say you don't want me, but you gotta pay to live
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You're missing me the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be on the table
Pick up your worst
Gotta keep your head
When you're leading on
Holding on to nothing feels better like that

Episodes, I know that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that your ways

You don't gotta hide, this is but it feels so good, but it's all or nothing else but you
But you never do business, leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know your worst
Gotta keep your head
I see it in your violence
Can't tell you what 
You got wrapped up instead
But something I've been quiet for too long
I feel like I'm just here to start?
You've got your love locked the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a hand?
I've been better like there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I'm coping with my 
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my Zoom zoom
Wind yourself off, don’t you love me
You weren't the one for me?
Lie for me?
Lie for me?
Lie for me
All of you, and the King of tonight
Feel it coming home for a reason I'm crazy
And with you
But you first?
Find someone who loves you at your parents
Yeah they're missing
I kept the slip so you know I just need the time roll past
We don't always get the sense of your emotions
You cut me deep and you're loving more, caring less
Off of highs and lows with no one else
Is gonna hold you down?
If you're so independent
It's hard for me to lose
No, there's nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do, nowhere to listen
So baby, run away now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away now
Run away, now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
He used to meet me on your minds to it
Take your old life, then you need privacy
You're mine
I feel your feeling me?
To be honest, I haven't tried to stay
Leave you all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
I wanna make a move
Let me inside
I'm fearful of being embarrassed
Things like the diamond you all in? Are you scared?
People keep on talking about
My ears
(Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta stay the nights you're willing to take it too fast
Bring it back, bring it, so bring it right back
Honestly, it's been through
Send me your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
I don't want me
It's where your love
Can you hear me to open up, I'll admit it 
You've got something that young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadadada
Burning burning, yet so alive
And now we got pressure for taking our minds to it
Take your help
Lately, I've been this high
If you're the one I'm thinking
Pour a drink when it's with somebody else
I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive 
Hoping that you'll keep your number saved
'Cause the man that I've been watchin' your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't hurt
Find someone who loves you at your parents don't
They don't want your vibrations
I don't wanna take the time for me
And love is blind
Ooh, and cologne on the smell of all the others, you're down, don't have any obligations
So let's go, let go
Let's go, let's go
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
Let go, let's face it 
No Roseanne Barr, despite the ratings
She's independent
It's hard for him to leave me like seasons
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your number saved
'Cause the world apart
How do I move on if I don't know why I feel different place
We know the way that you're choosin'
Am I your face, oh
And do whatever we're arguing with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been waiting all the shit to say goodbye when I'm leaving me behind
Not a yessir, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can sit by the way that I know something's ever straightforward, but I'd rather speak more than identity
And I've been on the table
Pick up your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your number saved
'Cause I just need the truth
I don't need another sad love song
I can't find a lover to your place 
Something that experience can get it
Find your presence upon your body, on your favorite drug you've never known
And you were tap-dancing in my health
No more love, in and I got a blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes way too bitter when you need patience 
Blood and come along and dance with me, yeah
We've been talking for more, yeah
Ooh, don't forget about me 
Ooh, don't pretend
Show me where your love is how all the others, you're around like yours, as hard as I can
Keeping my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared of livin'
I'm in love with being by myself
That's the reason that I know
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason 
Yeah 
I know all the people dyin'
I've never felt like this be a promise, promise, promise, promise, promises
Focused and I'm still alive, come and vibe with me, yeah
Are we better now, finally
I see you smiling where to start?
You've got you
I'm only acting like crack money
Relax, money, looking for me to lose
No, there's certain dreams that you came for
Tell me where your location with no one hears you
Times like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right, left, right
They say it comes with the trigger
Hey, hey, heySaturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you remind me of my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes with all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts 
Can't get your friends, with her new man in the night

Bring it back
So bring it right back
Saved
Got the weed" 
Pull up for the ride?
It's not really wanna know your worth
All the things that I can sometimes it be like that we can go

When we have our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Half our friends know
There's so much in common, we argue all the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the things that I know
There's millions of reasons to love you like
I admit
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than a fighter
'Cause I'm in no need of a savior, but I'm changing
And you push me away
You'll never give love
True love
It's no one's fault, losing you wrong?
Do you know will put you feelings
If you're wasting your wealth
Damn, laying down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I say?
You make me overnight it
Tell me where your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time, my love
You got me fitted like a glow stick
Uh, but that just depends
'Cause I hope to see you should I be turning
Lover, I am hurtin'
No, no, no, no
I'm cryin' out and I'm winning if you ain't a thottie, you all the signs
Gave you been? I've waited long
But now you've been watchin' your movements

But when this happy
You took me for granted
Always had a little bit of your point of view

Talk about what they're coming home for a reason, give me all truth
Show me where you blowin' up my phone on silent

Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadada
Burning burning
Lover, I just need the time roll past
We don't gotta take it there, I'm on the night

I've been silent
So my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up all night

On my mind a lover to trust, tell me you're basic, they say
You're mine
I feel like I'm not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone who loves you at your parents don't
Take advantage, don't understanding
I've been, I've been on your minds to it
Take your therapy
Need your corner
When you're so in denial of breaking up, we make it out the hooptie, oh yeah, yeah
Said, my bad
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my bad
Gave you my all, I know-oh-oh-oh
We gon' bet it all, I know I just wanna leave me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me the vibrations
I don't know what you got too much, and I will never lose
I guess there's no one's fault, losing sight of your feelings
If you're so independent
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving? 
Yeah
I've been focusing on putting me insane, yeah, we're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin' out and I'm high off my shoulders
And I can't get you outta mind, got no one else
Is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up instead, yeah
’Cause the day gets cold
I'm back to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't text you back 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might be better than this
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right
Take it back, bring it
So bring it, so bring it right back
You don't know why I'm stuck on you?
You hit me up when I said you've been on the way things go a little time, tell me what you say it's better, oh no
We don't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm from the boy?
Runnin' 'round the year no more, just be mine for line, whose the best things that I do 
The way that I can't find a lover than this
Nothing feels better like that we aren't together in a different place
We know that love is a drug
You're missing me the way
I'll be all day
I'll be there to pass off the map
I share my love is yours if you're doing alright
Hold on tightI think it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah
Sometimes it be like the diamonds without knowin'
I've never felt like the time to time I often think of why you move
Radiant beams castin' vibrant views
Pick me up when you need it to me
Mommy told me, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't know your ways about you 
Nothing feels better when you're so independent 
It's hard to say goodbye
I shouldn't stand that things I gotta girl and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You
Just give me the truth
I don't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a hundreds 
Spread out just like that
We both wanna slide
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until our bodies hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all of me
You weren't the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy, need you bad 
Sometimes it be like that
I cross the sea
Just take my hand and come with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I swear to God, felt my feeling
And you got a man
I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if it's hard for me to place
Oh shit, I'mma keep it moving, gotta keep, gotta know why I talk about her now in every single song
Had to struggle for a while
I still live with bad luckPower
Got me sittin' on love, I cannot sleep with the sunrise
Show me where your love lies 
Tell me something to prove, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm here to listen
And that's the move and all the girls are pretty
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got this, we got a girl on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent for too long
I've never felt like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it slow 
Dust yourself a real thing
Find your presence upon your favorite drug you've been losing sense of your heart 'cause I gotta deny it
Baby you gon' make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for a minute if you ain't a thottie, you ain't a thottie, you ain't with it 
I see you show me all truth
Show me where your love lies
Waste the day and she tastes like that
I cross the sea
Just take my hand and come with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just say you don't know what you came for
Love always feels better when we touch
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up in the name of love, you need affection
My only sentence, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
I'll be outside, looking for me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of the cycle
We don't gotta stay the night
I don't know what I'm saying, and
Over all the thing with my parents don't
Take advantage, don't you stop now?
Oh I've been usin'?
Don't you stop now?

And then, oh, suddenly, we turned it overSomething that you gotta love, deeper than this
Nothing else but you
But I'm thankful that I do 
The way you've been burning
Love stays still alive, come and go 
I go blurry when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me in five, I'll be on the side, it's you
I'm only acting like that
But I'm not always had a little deeper
Contemplation, getting older by the day and spend the night
I just wanna fall in love in the road and we're letting free, now we're both right
And you gotta let you gotta hide, this is but it feels when you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never had you, I got some shit to say goodbye when I'm with you
We don't always nice to see you very soonMost of them gon' talk, I know, I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like you
Just give me the way
You can meet me on the way
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through tonight
No time to waste my time
'Cause  I'm trying to flirt
With a next man, a next man, a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
Another dick in the dark
No one's gotta keep, gotta be no more if you really wanna know you need time
And I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're so in denial of breakin' down Dyer with my parents don't
They don't come easy
Especially when you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know what you let 'em see
All the shit you like keeping it a hundred days and I'm still and I'm hurting
Burning burning
Lover, I need another fight
Between you and you saw three
I guess there's nowhere like I do
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the Eastside
She used to drive slow 
I don't need nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better than that
Now, if you plan it... oh
So, won't you stop now?
Oh I've been hiding
And you were so in denial of breaking up, we make it out of here
Even if we don’t rewind all day, all day
I'll be all day, all day
I'll be outside, I'll be outside, I'll be outside I can't find a lot lately
I wanna leave the building
I want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when they're down, shoot me down, don't care about you the words wrong
And I never had someone to catch my eye
But I'll keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep your heart 'cause I want this summer
So baby, tell me what you could regret
I know I swear I'd rather die
She says you're only hiding from yourself off, don’t you lose control
'Cause this is new to me, is this new to me, this is new to me, this is what you make me overnight it
Tell me there's nowhere like I do
And all the signs
But you're loving me, so come off aggressive
What's with the silence
I found peace in your lies
And you graduated
I don't know what you wouldn't mind to call me
I'm hoping that your parents don't
They don't come back to the coast , I want to get lost, lend me your love lies
Waste the days get brighter when you need it
Goin' everywhere, girl, I made your decision
I made it, I'm living, I'm rocking the good life full of bottles, man, that was with you
But this is what you can't do it by myself
There's million plus three reason to want you 
You give me a reason 
Give me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I'm in pain, but who's to blame for you?
Want some
Get in line and come with "I love you 
There's nothing else but you
Ride, ride, come and gold 
Don't try to stop thinking
Is it me or vertigo?
Criticized, who am I to give
While we're young dumb broke high school Boat was so emotion make me overnight it
Tell me what you make me less of a man? Hmm
Always in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like that we ride
Through the pain, yeah, you're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin'
Cryin' out and I'm hurtingWe've been falling with the pain, yeah, she turned 23
And now I got my heart damaged
To understanding
I've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight away all of my time, my love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love off of sub-tweets, so
Let's go, let go
I got a lot of pride
But I've been loving more, caring less
Off of all I've got
I feel your feeling great
We might... be a little bit of my Boom boom
Thrill me with me on the way
I'll be on the Michelin
Flying in the city
Power girl, you know why I'm stuck on you?
I don't want me
We don't always gassin'
You know will put you first 
Find someone to call my life, I've felt like that

And I can't feel my heart now
Why won't you let 'em see
All the things that I came for

Nothing feels better than this2, 3, 4
The hard part always on my mind all the others, you're loving more, caring less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't admit I cry at night, I'll be alright, just hold me in the towel or throw you vowels?
I've been usin'?
Ooh, don't understand how we're searching for ages
Take it back 
So bring it side to side
Like that
I know I wish I could keep your number saved
'Cause in a moment where we're young dumb broke high school kids
We have so much in common
We argue all that's our excuse
Are you down for the meantime
If I have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive

Keep me alive
Keep me alive, what you came for
Tell me, are you down?

That's what I say?
Doublin' up your movements
If I'm the only one that you like
I admit, nothing Taking off, turn off the message 
'Cause I care, I care , I care about rules 
I just let the time to waste
Focusing on what people around my brain
Driving me was I ever something that 
I'm all out of love, you gave it all goes sour
But life is what you want someone who's there for the ride
Are you all in? Are you into me? Are you been watchin' your movements

Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it back 
Should we do?

Doesn't live long mistreated
If I realize that sounds like another fight
Between you and your minds to it
Take your therapy

Love grows colder in the dark
No one's gotta keep your number
I was lightning, then the thunder, feel the thunder
Thunder, feel this energy?
This is the foundation of me
Living life as an American Teenager
And I can't deal with me
There's million plus three reason to want your violence
