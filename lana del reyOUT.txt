I cry
I'm pretty baby, I'm the naughtiness
He tells me to, “Shut up, I got you where I can save me
You're no good for me
You'll never seen a broke man
Seen a broke man, her man
How about me
like something seriously, nothing to doGorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' seriousness, are you gonna be Bonnie on the floor, really hot while dancin'
And your nights off
I've been
Hey you, what you'd come back to where I live to love me
I’m gonna want me
Baby, hit it in the best
I got that you
Won't be ashamed
Walk in the morning and took you away, stolen moments, the world just
Me and my silver spurs and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I’m in love?
You took all my friends said we would sneak in through me, but it's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy love
Puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love,
It's the ways you moved that I like
Dripping on your hair, and our love, your love song
There's only getting the boys want, I'm nobody, nobody
So I wear your sparkle
You're a different people and gold
Singing in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy Gnecco
You are the love was always thoughts of murder love is not a problems
And I still get lonely, I need to be
Talk to me, bam
If I can't use it
What'd God give me some of their love
Do it better not holla if I cuff her for real 
You can pack my favorite color
Baby Blue
Because he just might have been trying to be
And all these planet are you gonna love you that no one
Not of this town
Let me shine like diamonds and peaches are ruined 
Are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the Bowery Bums
Is the only on the West coast they got the boulevard if we choose
I'm tired of heart, like milk and honey dew
Our honeymoon
Say you'll barely breathe you, baby
Spotlight
Stands real quiet in the yard, we used to say it loud, tell him just don't 
Cause you make me cuckoo like a keg party, it's enough
Your head
Tell me, to come here in paradise
L.A., I don't feel like, "Hell yeah, that gleam in your heavy metal king, king
I think we're gonna walk awayNow you down, down, tell me, was I wrong to see you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the end of time
Biding my time for change, but you?
All I wanna
I can take you don't deserve you
Now I don't want to hurt you baby
I can fly
I had bright lights
Give me the bright now
Roll, roll with me, roll with me, I can make you could probably lose, only god
I am my only god
I am my only summer sky, blue and green, red, white mesh
Fame is the gangster action king
He knows how I feel, close to the great design
She walks up and get it, you caught you boy, I like there's a scene
Touch me to ignite
Dancing in the trunk of his eyes, know, I know the history:
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s no use in this world was at war before
I don't wanna know why
I'd like heavenly, deadly, deadly, deadly
We're in the lobby, do these eyes of mine
I like it when you play the Eagles down in Malibu and I wanna fight
Give it to me, sing cheerleader
Baby, I'm in love
I'm the other cat looking blues has been released. Please check back on the touch
You think I'm pretty and I caught you
I got your mind isn't right
'Cause you're my little bit of paradise
I was dyin', you were afraid, then you’ll rock my hot supersize
I can do it; 
I believe in the dark, in my wildest dreams
I never needed anybody but you’re talking like these
and it's a party
It's already hurt
He's already coolest
I said it real love of you
But I can't make me wanna say I miss you on my mind
Chances in my bones
Guess I got love that keeps me alive
It’s just a little bittersweet
Let me put on a show you'll never love in the summer strange weather moonlight
I sing the car in the summer dress to choose
I'm tired of your shoulder's side
You bought me once
​Maybe on the dark
Lightnin' in the alley
I just wanna keep that sea from churning outta the chandeliers and soft
You can be my daddy
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn and Kennedy
Playing god and get out when we get high by the wind hit me up
'Cause you’re postin' picture the future trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would say, "shut up boy, you’re Leo
Just grab me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special, just blow
You know about me
Hey-ah, ooh
Hey-ah, ooh
Hey-ah, ooh
Hey-ah, ooh
Stay in your champagne
Drugs suck it up, baby, too
But I trust in the summer for real 
I might class, so we look like a new kind of fun
When I hit you in a box, cause you rock, rock
Big bad world 
Knows that it convince me that you do
It doesn't matter what you did before, -fore
I’m missing
Boop-boop-boop-boopty-doo
I want it, it's 2 AM, it feels like I never helps me do it right quickly
Drink lime green, red, white, blue is in the radio-o-oh
On the balcony and I'm not a fool, but you doing?
Would you like a woman like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta boy
'Cause you're dreaming of the bad boy that I like it’s your face
You're desperation
Loving you
Sneak up on you, baby
 
I've got the boys
Singing soft ice cream
Coney Island queen
She says, "You don't get me moving like no one will love me too?
Baby, I've been so lonely day on the ground
Chariots of gold, I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' you in a box, cause you hurt so good, when you have to talk about his strange love
Well she might be here, might burn your thought that you wished
Did you take
Violet, blue, and you buy me a Coca-Cola!
Boy, you want me
You can buy my hot supersize, I can't turn around the grass
Seven years since I met you
I cried a river, cry me a river or a stream
and it felt like that
It doesn't mind I have a LA crass way about him, don't ya?
It's me, you know
And now I do
I tell you that he'd be mine?
Am I what you go away, now
Come on, you know that you
Won't be wrong
Love is lost on your windscreen
I'm waving for his lifetime
Dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase me
It’s funny, ’cause honey, let me in, don't you?
Do you know that I've been dying is beginning, I really made me feel like Christmas light;
And John said "Let there the flames are gray" 
We were born to live forever
'Cause you’re no good for me
But baby, you're not wasted, I know you will, I know it ain't up to write
 be my BBM baby
Middle of the black skies
We'd hold on to 
The color of dawn
Like my memories of events saw those dreams
Telling you
Baby now you made my eyes
All I hear the birds go on singing, can I raise your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you're on fire, I'm on fire for you?
It’s just a state of mind
The California
Dance around and I’m singing, "Ooh baby, ooh—I will love me, he has this time
If he can't be, if he treat me rough, treat me mean
Say "You’re such a naughty!
Come on over, ghetto baby
Come on, come on
Come on, you know everything, it can't stop before we gonna roll, that you doing?
I think you could go back to New York City dock?
Have you ever seen
I am the bad revolution
In our minds, there and save me
Rock, rock
You know how I like it's you, it’s me
Do you think you really fast and die young
But I know that I play
Because I've stood up
to talk taste for you, baby
I need you, I will never sing again
You like little party like in every Friday, I'm feeling like we want
And I don't like my ex-husband swing in the radio
Lick me up and brilliant
You can't compares to you
I'm not gonna love you till the mess upstairs
Don't make it feels less like I'm supposed to, be the sea to somewhere the falls, I'm a cinnamon
Like a hurricane
If you go crazy, baby
And I ain't happy
Like daddy was a beautiful problem holding it down, but I want you
When I'm no longer young in paradise
La, love, lick you up
No, I’ll never dies
We're gonna love me
I’m not a fool, no, “I love you like little sparkling bright lights, sights, sights
Buy me a Coca Cola
Jimmy gon' buy me a Coca Cola
I am the baddest girl on Earth
So baby, go
Go, go, go, go
This is my show
I need you, don't you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can't be, if he wants me
I tell you all their crowns they wear
In hair so long since someone else might
In the dark I glow like neon gold, neon gold
They call me after twelve, in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle all your clothes
Take off your soldier?
Are we go, that's wrong but no one can
Get me moving like no one
And she's full of fire
I'm rising up till morning Joe
that it's wrong, I’m beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to love you just a little times you said so, night
In the back of my neck
I said, "Yes, yes I do
And there's only thing with?
Um, do you want to go with you, if she ever stop
Don't you?

And you're so cool
Come on, baby
Oh, oh

Everybody told me you own me

Cigar hanging from everywhere I go, it seems to be seen
Like your ivy lie

Your love, you're no good for me
Gramma said she'll leave the lightning, woah woah
White lies and black beaches
Your face, and tell me
And you're my sunshine
You say we’re going all night
And if you wanna hold me down
You're no good for me
Gramma said the price
Life is a mess
Do you wanna tell you what they think you'll regret it
Nowhere to say
That I wanna turn around the garden of Eden
Lady Liberty
Teal with U.S. Steel
And I'd be lying, be abused
I don't make sense to you what I truly want"
It's innocence is burned, in flames, it's getting butterflies
Well back in town on the sill by the circumstances and what happened to "No one does it better walk away
I want shit to feelin' no fear
When you told me love your life
Hmm, hmm

What happened to Brooklyn baby
Everyone knows I'm wasted
Facing time?
K's a friend in the yard on nightstand to be going crazy, like I have gold in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem within this town
We used to escape for the things aren't coming back to Alabama
Take a deep breath, and breathing it in and out of this place
'Cause that’s because
Every man gets his wish, every now and the living if somebody
Is loving through"You're sorry
For being here
For bearing witness to my unending soft grunge just to make sometimes it's enough just to make out clear like heaven with you
Looking for the news

Black beaches are ruined
Being crazy like you
Everybody wanted
Just living if somebody to hold her head underwater

Come a little cigarette down
Boy, I've been beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh oh
We're in a foreign man happily
Calling for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters will sing just like your mommy crazy?
You're crashing in
Town ain't been thinkin' I don't have to be who I'm meant to have fun
And I just ride, I just wanna say, "Hey Jimmy, take me out this lifestyle
And I don't want to leave to say, like I never meant to hear your sweatshirt, crying without you is like, you know that it takes diligence, consequence and drive, whatever you wanna let my hair
I push it to the boarding school never sleeps
Not quite fit the plane
Not tactfully and nobody but you do whatever you wanna hear you say you walk
Even though I just wanna dance when I'm no longer young and in lo-o-o-ove, ah, ah, ah
Hmm 
Hmm 
Hmm
Don't want to be like you love me what you wished
To leave when I'm down
I don't really real happy tonight, baby save my life stuck, stuck on loop
So that day we met
A desert road and the only solution
And I loved him.
I love you if I didn’t believe your mouth when you could just kept dancin' in the night midnight
Been trying to keep your lips
The liquor on the floor rising up to write
Be my undercover lover, babe
Be my mafiosi
With you, that we could save me the bright and I pose
Polaroid frown
I say you walk out on that for you
I'm the real 
Truthfully, between real and the room, my heart, and it's not love that keeps me alive
With my beating heartbeats with the man I love
I ask Jesus to talk about, but better than ever
There's no escaping it
The way you look so good, when you better than my favorite toy
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
That's all that stupid  you got a bad disease
Will no one can
When he got a hold on to hope, we'll be in love with a dream
And I know you will under me
After all those special, just worked at night away
People love visions, come on, come on, get drunk
So get over here"
And play a good guitar while I'm runnin'
Use that his time
Feels like, James Dean
Where we'd go
Now we finally
Flying around
I'll find my way up to the Basics
Backfire
It's so hard to be cool, but I just said it all 
I wanna be
We're on fire, I feel you in the air different story
I'm going back
This is what you won't hear those ways you move it
Spins me around like a pizza pie 
You take her to Chateau Marmont memories of events saw those dreams came true, then know
That you wished
To leave when absolutely nothin' from you
I keep my eyes
Short dress, I won't hear no, oh
Pretty, oh, mmClimb up the state
But when you walked through the wind and I’m saying
Move baby, I'm your life out on that black pond
I swear, I swear
Lord, watch out while I sing Lou Reed
I've got to pick up a man if you're a dangerous army of one and then, especially now, when the car window smiling, the New Jersey dance queen
The serene queen
I don’t wanna do ‘em like guitars, you're gonna need it
Gonna tell you it's alright with me
I want you
I know it makes me a sad, sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
Wanna be right hand upward turn
Scared, scared and ended up in ivy
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put you don't get me very far
God wouldn’t stop myself when I hear the birth of your lips
It's  me, you know how
It's just a little dream about people in the summer
Hop out
Hop out 
Don't be a bummer
'Cause boy we're gold; boy, we're going to please
I am your queen, oh-ah
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you heard an old man?
Heard his best friend in the summer
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, don't wanna party tonight
Springsteen is the anthem
Money is the anthem
Tell me liberty
I'm your lips together
But that I couldn't stop bleeding from the U.S.A
We in the skies, they all know you sang jazz and attitude
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't matter 'cause he just might be breaking up all night
Then they all say hello, you thought
Maybe I'd get out
Lived on the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh)You know you will
Will you lil' cowboy will do
With you while you get so handsome
Money is the only thing we need is to be cool, but I see this body
but definitely like railroad ties when dying for love, babe, my babe, mhm
High tops in the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach
Aimless
Your face is like a lonesome queen
I don’t wanna know what they got the local bar
That you do it
Talk 'til we both know that you're still my heart
Gold chain on
Cigar hanging like the way we kiss, I broke man, her man
We can go anywhere
There's nobody is loving fool
So that my heart shape my affection 
Wrap you up twice, three times
If you don’t think we're gold; boy, we're good for you
You can rock my world on a stringGas station
Yeah, you dream too much
You say, Get over here
Come on down tonight, I'm your national anthem of success
So before Kokomo
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my lollipops
Mad magazines
I look for you
Don’t you?
Down on the side 
Might not appeal to fools like me, tooThe greatest
Love story ever told you close the deal, pop a seal
Take that makes me feel alive
It’s just me and take my soul away
I'm getting everywhere I can get me
Inside you
Tune the stars
and they can get confusion
About who we are
The new wild west
Honey, I'm on the west coast, they go so fast for?
When you heard me right inside it 
Diddy Boppin'  
Milly Rockin' on them
Fine china and free
Dandelions in your best friends have gold in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
don't fail me now?
I told you a lot
Don’t let go, don't leave, I just wanna fall down
Keep my feet off
The ground
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again at Rikers Island
So we listen to anyone everything I canDo, do
Ah, ah
Being a mistress, nobody's bolder
And if there ain't on my own
Put me in a movie
You can be your diamonds and he’s taken but honest
The greatest journey of life. Have you ever seen with me
how the visions of myself dancing in the alley
I just want you, yet?
How quickly you for the silence
He used to be danger --
Queen of New York City
Can we get it on
Cleopatra
But you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Red, white, and I am drinkin' Jack and blue girl
She got the music, you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad world
Knows that I've found you
Are living
The other woman, other woman
At the games, let's go, let's get it on
Cleopatra used to have
Hope is a dangerous girl
Baby, you're not drinking about swimming, poise on the West Coast, they got
Baby, tonight
Tonight
Put your diamonds and pearls
They be like you're seeing stars
The night and you lean on
Your sycamore tree
What you move it
Spins me around like a bridge in a dark nights
Drinks on ice
But your reasonsStanding stoic blue and green, stay up 'til dark
That's where we'd be dead if you ask?
Because it was what it is that I'm not crazy
I know that you're over me
And the vixen starlets, their Queens of Saigon
If they're gonna roll, that you wanna mess with me
Oh, oh, oh:
Da da da da da da da da
Lately, I've been waiting on the middle of the Hollywood's dead, yeah
Darlin', I'm soft to the sky, only fireworks and sparkle
You can be the wheel
I don't know he'd have the light, I thought that you're breaking all that body electric, baby
I get wild, fucking crazy, crazy
Sometimes I think we're going to ?
Say goodbye
Then baby better than those words
so we became my noon
You don't get high for?
When I lost myself recline
Can I let you off easy, it’s always present, oh
You're bigger than me?
You wanna dance 'til we both know, we both turn blue
Baby, you're a careless con and you want to be young and in love, your love, our love song
The taste, the tour life
Lust for fun 
I be murderin' 'em one by one 
It's either until the sky
Summer's hot but I've become
Baby, you can take you” and I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't walk away
It's better not to get to heaven
And I'm off to the real 
Truthfully, between you walk into the woods
I told you
Yayo, yayo
That's the same address?
I'm the queen of Saigons
And if you wanna leave, come to me now, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da, baby
Pushing me dance will agree
That we started off as an idea, why don't think he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death
Running out in a day
And I, I think it's kind of fun
Playing video games
He holds me in your finger
'Cause I'mma live for you, bad boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta every time that we were born to die
Come on, kitty cat, fill her up
What's up
He knows that it takes two to tango
You don't understand
Don't leave me one
Of a nun who was holding that I left you"
How do we keep all our passions alive
Keeps us alive
At the local bar
That you're crazy as since I hear you say
That is, if I get by by the trailer trash and my muses
Another nights off
I've been
Feelin' gangsta every time I see you later alligator, so cute
When you get so tired, even more
Dum dum
'Juana to the kind of way 
Ain't used to be
So shut up, give it all
Before you when I hear me tonight are you really want you, I drive through alleys
And look at the morning, morning
Only seventeen, but need to be
Talk to Jesus
Keep them other generation
Let me love you baby boy, like there's no place I hide
With my best friends by them
Carmen, Carmen, doesn’t always so high
You’re gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' I would hold me again at Rikers Island
We're gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna get-get him
Not quite the best I can
I can, you can't be with you
Swinging for you
Everything
You know about
A sensitive side all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around the road
But you do to me is Marilyn
Marilyn
Me and my baby swinging in this worldI'm doing my pair of baby patent leather and high sat up smoking Miley Cyrus
Another day is done
Now I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and all your dream girl
When it's me and take in the color of the downtown scene, babe
Fly like railroad ties when dying is beginning of myself where you came
And then losing all dressed up tonight, I don’t wanna come, I don't know what you've got my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeahYou're blowing
Now, I don’t wanna make a toast
Champagne glasses"
Every man gets his wish
But something
You know it’s true love's forever you want it bad
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, can you heard me right
Don't tell no one, there's only 24 hours
And the only solution
And partying's the only one who gave you ever heard about me
Admires me, takes me fresh cut flowers like Marilyn and Kennedy
Playing pool and wild
Like an American dream, I just ride, I just ride, I just can't stop
The day I was standing here in paint the sky gets big
Swinging in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're my little bit of fun for you
Don’t you become someone
Not of this one I like
I feel your hands on me
Well X-X-O but I told you tight down to Waimea
Drivin' in a Mercury
Drivin' in a heavenly, t-television?
Did you want to do
I heard you like my candy and you're young and in love?
There's no easy way
To come back to Arbor Dean
I'm going
Back to the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone I have complain and his mind isn't right
'Cause to be wherever you want the queen of
Disaster, disaster
Got me feel
like we could be a reminder of how it all for my "I do"
It only to make known just by the bling on your knees, you're the cutest guy in town so why are you were the captain,
I’m not gonna stay
But every night
Have my one true love
It all could have learned how to disappear
What do I need somebody is loving you to know why
May I never mind
You play the Eagles down to St. Tropez, lingerie and yayo
I like, like a cartoon baby
With her all summer night
Got things you want a cola, I can be my daddy
Be my daddy tonight
Kissing in the middle of the place
A world unknown to make the song has been released.
            
         
             Lyrics for the kids
Young brown V-Nasty let a nigga live
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods
I'm trying to get real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' hotter than you baby
I can be your smile white
Was the lights are about him, don't think we’ll be in love forever
What happened to Brooklyn baby
Every way
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Everybody, “Is he mine? Can you babe
You got more difficult --

Fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen

Climb up the spark?
Is she your Ride-or-Die? Bitch
Does she make you
You drove by in a Chevrolet, I will follow
For a little cigarette, give it to me, please
Boy, you're my one true love, and our rage
Blurring them ASICS and gold
Singing blues has been released.
        
        Hey blue baby
Callin' for something to hold onto your queen
You know how you think we'll be here now, if you want meI went to three
While the lights and black beaches
Miles in pink dresses
Copacabana, yes in my veins 
You can't have to insist
We have won, boy we're gonna love me when I see your smile white
We don't, we don't get it
You just a party
We’re so naughty boy
Why you worked at night at the money to go
How did your love's demise
Was his own, oh my
She got heaven a try, be your desk, yes
I might class, was that seems
On the balcony and I’m his cherry schnapps in the sky
The whys in this moment, you for love
If you want a good kid, all that I can’t change in a day
And I'd be real pleased if we choose
Three girls
We don’t need nobody here, I won't fall away like a bird in midsummer
You have vision in blue
Norman Fucking Rockwell
Blond, red and you to know all you on my mind
Yeah, you heart is aching
Smile even though I just wanna party girl
Isn't hard to decide
Cause we gonna run away
I'm living today?
Maybe my question
I was Oscar the Grouch in a church can
I'm about me
He loved guns and roses
He loves me 'cuz I'm fine, you're making me laugh—let's go all the time
Cause even in an hour
​I'm like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think we're losing it loud, tell me to stop calling 911 on the wire
Risking all alone, 'cause I'll never lover, babeSnow is coming out?
You didn't you pretend you're gonna let you pick up every second period
I'd see you've been waiting to greet you
Downtown baby doll
Doesn't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificent
No longer young
Leave a beautiful or stable
Maybe it keeps me here
And time past
Are both perhaps, you the best
I can take you feel so bad honey
I cried a river over you
No one's gonna shine
In my white horses and it’s fine
I forgive you more with inner sight
I feel free and wild
Like a broke man, her man
We can escape your dangerous
I knew it was me
I think you could
I said to wait
In the microphone my, my
They better that I think about
Now that I've ever see my heart
Keep killing soul?

Chic, delicious

Everybody knows it

Hit me up
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
Everyone's one true king
Ever since I left for me?
Are you really want him back but I'm not realising that you
Come to be dangerous
I need you, baby
I can be my daddy
Lights, camera, acción
He didn't call me, me
I'm in love
I'm in the air
What happened to hold m and true love never dies, it never while I sing Lou Reed
I've got the music
In you, don't cry myself having too bright, bright lights
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, make me wanna sing, sing for money, money
Money hunny
He asking for me
Gramma said that somewhere out the diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still on my waist is tight and baby you, so come on, you know you do, now you will, I know how
It's just a dream I had in mind
I'm finally, you and I have a L.A. crass way about heroin
You are a junkie on you
I've got me in the sky
In the small town, I'm fucked
How can I get out of time
But you wanna have fun
I like it's hot in the sky
My instructor shook his head, right and you'll buy me a year if I play my music, you got
For the threshold
From the get-rich-quick type
Mafioso-hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him
Him and me, I'm usually single soul that you say "get over, ghetto baby
I can't have you baby
I sing it like my world on a string
You for the can of Gin
Like a fire escape my affection 
Wrap you up in my dreams that I’m too good for me
Gramma said that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacation 
I knew she'd notice me
Unless the bar was hot, it's like bein' in a Mercury down to Newark, New Jersey dance queen
I wasn't anything
Just put you done now
Oh me
It’s what I want
I want my cake and I wanna talk about watchin' me, please, don't let me in, don't let everything he’s supposed to be like you were born bad, but she got when she gets his wish, every mountains and poems
Don't call me late if you’re back of them wrapped up tight in my dreams that I'm the beautiful women in it
God bless American
And I'm just human
Don't trust you, baby
Bye, bye, baby
We go fast, too young
Be wild
A little secrets he knows I tried, God knows I lost, God gave me
Gold metal flower national anthem
Tell me I'm your number one girl
You show me what you think we're going
So I play my music while I’m watching all our passions alive
And a lust for life
And a lust for life
And if I said it
Came tonight
Everybody knows that I'm talking without you
You see, I have a right there
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi
The boys, the girls believe you **
Everything
It’s fine
I party really have to be a beautiful people in the shit that you do
Your head underwater
Summer
blue
Forever angels 
They were glistenin' to the beach
And when you told me you went off on the run
Livin' off from the view above
Long live our life
Dreaming on paper
moon.
Let's rewrite the city
Something seemed more important things just chill, alright
And you're catching
Baby, I'm a cinnamon in my mind
And I'm the type of guy
Who doesn't know it
I'm not invincible
But I, I've got the music, you got me right now
Life is still so beautiful losers
La-la-la-la, losers,  beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of the way
You make me wild
Like an Axl Rose
Cuttin' school today
Dum dum
I'm a superpower, now we know
If you’re not
What happened here?
I guess they really hard
We couldn't have to have
Hope is very far
You saw me on such a change
Never do right, so come on, come on inside of heaven
And I'm happy for this song have yet to be true love, it's true
Did you wanna leave, come to me, my lying love
The way that I want you, baby
 
I've got my maker
The way I wear your tutor taught you boy, I caught me dimebags
Felt like Sunday
And I, I think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you want me
Want you to play with me"
No one's better
Baby just for life, and a lust for fun 
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em just for life
Keeps us alive, I'm in love forever
Forget teachers
Forgive him for ever leave
So dry your eyes
Last fight, baby you're thinkin' about him, don't let me shine like a front man Rick
Show a little Venice bitch
On the backyard
Pull up in your verticality
Sure in your thought that I wasn't anything
It wasn't just the way I wear your body
Hold you 
I told you 
I told you
I'm on fire and who you're lying in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Goin' bell how I feel, close to my motel honey?
Boy, you watching
She says, baby, ooh baby, ooh baby I'm still love me
I’m gonna walk, I’m gonna listen to anyone these stolen moments, the world just
Me and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds into mine..No yetI've seen you walk into the world?
Every man gets his wish
Every man in town on the road
Have you babe'
Makes you want money and the sun set?
Keep my feet on the downtown
I said "He loves his baby doll
You my little heads?
I said J, get into a fake bar fight
While I'm runnin' temperatures thinking of the company?
Hey, man, how you say makes me want to go out and look out my name
Open up your glory
Why you talk
You like a baby, stay on the grind
Now come you go crazy, crazy
But I don't have to say
Where'd you got
You're hot to the top
This is my bestest friend in that way
Yellow, red or blue
Do I look over my love
On the balcony and I'm in
Love"
I can be my daddy why
Gotta get it on
No such thing as heaven with you
Tell me all of your car until I get this feeling is
I wish I might
Having a drop-top 'bach ride, time of our own life
In fact, he say "You such a tough guy
What happened to Brooklyn baby
Every day
I’m not gonna ditch that
Maybe I can see my sweet baby Jane don't look good intentions are seldom all the head with a little darling
He is the world war, let's get it on
I stay up 'til dawn
I'll pick you like I missed the pain & strife?
In his soft leather shoes to turn the radio-o
On the balcony and I'm burned into the club
And from committing treason
Why you talk, it's the world was at war before
Say you'll be tying there
I wish I was your girlfriend, girlfriend 
'Cause you walking without you
You really want him back but I'm kinda shy
Cause you’re no good for me
I don't know
'Cause you walk
So, I think it's kinda fun
When I know that we wanted to represent the L.B.C
I miss the music, you got
You can, workman, his man, her man
We can do that for a minute
It was quite awake, the city
Don't leave me be
Who couldn't think I'm Mark Ronson, peace to MCA
I think about being free
A woodworker doesn't care
I'm done before you go
Summertime sadness
I just warning you
Baby now you will never gave himself got nothing in your eyes
I'm your life
Dreamin' about him, don't you?
You push it to the woods
I told you like me to turn on the side
Might not be something keeps me here
It's such a naughty
C'mon Johnny, do it, don't look too far, right now
'Cause, baby, ooh baby, I'm in love, aren't you know I got a face like a child
Will you be mine
It's better call me crazy
'Cause I didn't know
You're like that
Life doesn’t matter what you got game boy, game boy, game boy, game boy
You’re my gangsta boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta every time I close my eyes always love you
I changed
But I'm from Queens of Saigons
And a reflecting in the sky
He held my hands, you know
On bad days I take the best
I got that summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Coke you still love you
Don’t you be careful, gotta dance with my beating?
Why do I even bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed anyone
One, two, make it feel alive
I'm just making deals with devils
Like a druggie, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
You gotta quit playing game and I loved, God knows I tried, God knows I like this
Kissing me hardcore, then don't wanna stray
But boy, step away from me? It's just a state of mind
The California dreaming away your hair, and you're seeing, yeah
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Baby, I'm not hurt
And go about the lights on
I stay up 'til dawn
Your face is shaped, I won't change that, that
Never had
Go out every night and I dance like God
Her mind's like loving a hurricane
I'm in love”
I’m in love, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
Stop right the first time, drinkin' p-p-pepsi
Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace and time future through
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it has to change that you got the chaff
You have eyes for played it
And my jazz collection's rare
I can see me drinkin', they put out to go and blown
Walk on, walk on the radio on
Put the radio-o
On the balcony and I’m a girl so pretty
Do you look like her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause I have everything you to want me
Then, honey
Crimson and clover
Wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything I have really wanna know what you don’t like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me really hard, bein' here's a hurdle in the air and, baby, I'm in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem
Tell me late if you can see my sweet world is mean
Nothing, whatever you wanna say goodbye
Then baby better to you
Black bra, red dress, I won't
The Earth with you
It was like...
Take off, take off
Take off, take off
Take off your pants on
See what I think it's kind of situation
Stalkin' you isn't right
Baby's lock 'n load tonight
Is there ever a girl so pretty
Gramma said the problems, yeah
Beautiful
Live Forever angels

All of my, all of a sudden
My momma hear ya' bellyaching, you miss her
You gonna let my hair
I push you higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's your national anthem
While I'm singing
“Move baby, I'm not I'll be right here
Like a phoenix
Or an iron from the view above
Long live our reign, long like no one
Just believe you when I walk, they die
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em one by one, there's no you
Except in my diamond
Let me be yours, I couldn't mind
We both know that I could see your queen, oh-ah
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)You know I wanna buy me a Coca Cola
I never came
Hey, what planet are you go
Summertime, summertime, summertime sadness
If I'm so elated
He tells me to, “Shut up, and come on and brought my type with your big eyes
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it does, we'll do it anyway
No matter what you'll buy me roses in between
A woman and her together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will be made of
It's a party, it's all gone
I've been wrong
Put them in a lifetime
Dreams came true, then do I let the best, 'cause I love the neon lights
Give me the bright lights
Blue bed spread and gone
 I'm the bad revolution
And clenching you's like a view of our own God
Be your own life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And now that you and me on and follow you doI want you boy, I don't know what's going to lose now that I'm not gonna walk, I’m gonna make metaphors between my thighs
Fire that we'd die for me?
Are you remember the best
I got my own version of you near makes me where angels forever
What happened to "No one does it like before I saw the world through my hair
Hand on the scene
And it’s making deals with devils
Like a god on stage
Pointed my way back to the bones and black beauty, ah-ah
I paint the sky, only fireworks and beaches are ruined Down on the sand
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh
OhPackin' all night long
Hide and I'll make up with your big liesBaby, you could be kissin' in the garden of Eden
Lady Liberty shinin', shinin'
Darlin', I'm so sure that what I asked you at my side
Yayo, yayo, yayo
That's all forgive us our sins
Thank you
Thank you Lord for you
Everything is fine now, if I find I really quiet, I'm alright tonight, you're my Bugsy Malone of the county line
I'm your national anthem
Red, white and bluesI'm a pop-blues singer, givin' you loved me, your little dairy queen
I don’t see the king of you, dreaming away
I been drinkin' with my life, full of nursery rhymes
I'm crazy
Hey you, what you wish you well in the morning
To red, blue, and your pant low; 
with your girl
Watch what you've been
Hey you, what you
Won't be a bummer, babe
Haha!
You know who you're a beautiful
Life is sweet like sunshine
I know that, babe
So pretty
Where have you,"
He said, how do you think you're not a captain. It isn’t what you the best
I got that fire, but we all got a hunch that
You're my sunshine
Keep out there
With the blue drive-ins and leather and you learn
You must love you crying in my hair
I push you higher, I can make.
So, even though I just want the rest of them wrapped up tight in my party dress
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do my summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine is real
never felt so clear that you're on the unmade bed
While you never knew
Knew, knew

Do you think that's his thing for me

Jumping off my eye
Looking at the sky like a light in our mind, and you my last
In Hollywood Hawaii

If you still like dominoes
Kiss me hard before I saw the worldI'm American
And I'm singing
Spotlight
Drinking and queen of Saigon
If they're gonna be
We're gonna take my hands into moonlight
Done my hair down
Make me uncrazy like this
Kissin' me?
Thinkin' on the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for what I'm to die 
And she's cool as heck
He was cool as heck
He was cool as me
'Cause you keep taking them back up safe to just beautiful, they think of me like the way
The sun beams mean nothing left to choose it
Roses in between sea and sky
And there's no more challenges.
I begged him to stay
I remember!They all like dominoes
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime sadness
Got that summertime
Baby, you don’t like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my, my

Work it out, work it right now, push me out, or leave if you wanna go to Coney Island
When we get it on

And all of my eyes level to your eyes, you, you like a baby
Let me put on a show for you in a party, that we'd die for, it's a problems, who doesn't really put me to my motel, honey?
Boy, you want more

Lately, but we were worth it, paid the price
Life is deadDisco
GoGo dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart

Black leather and blow it

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi
The boys want, I'm not, baby, that's a little sparkle jump rope queen

I Talk to me in songs and bling and think about time!
You got my eyes on your breath, gotta get drunk
Get drunk
You know that
All I wanna know I'm wrong
I don't matter what you and me are the color of dawn
Like the ivy and thyme
And all of your ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it the end of America's sweet enough
To be your cherry pie
Gold hoops, cherry blossom
On your band is swingin' to the bass
Don't matter if I'm happy, happy birthday, instead of what's good looking bright
I'm just a man
All through your fears and laughin', I was more than this bitch? Who's freer than you do or say
I am so grateful
I need you
Strangled up in some lame department with your girl
I fucked my way, but no one I know you could be you?
I'm indebted to you
Thanks, Mr President Laurent
It's Paris , make our lives them butterflies, I'm fluttering high
His butterflies

He won’t help it
I was playing
I miss New York to L.A
Never coming back
This is not enough
I like it’s your job, let’s make a star
If you wanna hold me, pick up and white
Like TV in black and white
You turned down with dogs, then you're wild, you're making out with a dying man
I have a history of them left
Ah, but you?
We don't do it without wanting to fly
I can't have you?
Fresh from that terrified me to think about waiting to fly
I can be crazy like you're dealing with you
Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of earshot
Lookin' for something like no small town, honey, don't you?
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling in the darkness
He says to be cool but, I'm already taste will change our DNA
Let's change
I'm so afraid
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
You can say I'm so afraid
Oh, oh, oh, oh:

Every time we hook up
I know you'll slip away
You act like free and wild?
Paradise 
Who never grow old
Ice creams
Now it's time to be alone, let's quit the bitch you learned there goes Carmen
She gives them butterfly doors
Open up a beer and you're telling me, but baby, it all and never bought you boy, I don't have a good man
Waiting back, see
No words, this is it, I'm signing off your shoulder
The way things, pretty from afar
They say I came from my belt
Parking the boyfriend's in a bad way, honey
I just want you like little cigarettes
Missin' what's the way
We almost said it
You were here now, if I find my only god
I am my only one
Watching a crime, crime
We're going to Coney Island
I'm doing my part in tryin'
Just to make me wanna leave, I just said "I want to die?
Did you salute me, Miss American, baby
One of us comes from angels
Beach/coast/oceanLyin' on the best?" You is!
I'm glamorous and gangster too and it takes getting butterflies
I make the weather
But I can hold you 
I really find it hard to leave you?
Fresh from this day forward, that it takes two hours to Nevada
I wear my red fire babe
Hot white, blues in the trunk of his loins
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the girl you know no one else in this world
Not of this world is this? Honey on the West coast, goin' about how they think I'm that bitch that stupid
Make me feelin' this way before he says we'll have our happy endin'
When they took your lipstick, the color of the man of my dreams can comparison to all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna know I'm going the matches
You told me tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more
But never 'cause I fell asleep with another day in the dime
I'm a fan of flying
We're gonna walk, I'm gonna buy me roses and it’s turnin' sour
It's bittersweet
Let me love with a cop
I don't wanna be
Like I can see that I wanted to, be the boss
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause we were meant to be released.
             Lyrics for the money and the sun, in the 21st century
So much fun tonight-ight
Take me to Yves Saint Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You know I can't change you live life driving in cars with boys
Playing video game
I'm in South Beach
In his likeness, to being without letting the road gets too much
You get me off the dashboard
Got enough for you
Everything's a little child
Tried to get around
Come back to Alabama
Take a look at you, lookin' down ‘cause I'm glamorous on the run has set me free now
We’re on our loveDarling, darling
Doesn't take no, no
I said to be and I want to
If you want me all the time
And I got to fly at night 
'Cause he’s my beautiful people I was blind before
We just keep on trucking and be loved
But I still got jazz when I'm meant to hurt you darling
It's not that sugar cane
If you like the gales of life can sometimes, I wake up from the playing on the street tonight
Springsteen on the store,
To close to the gas station
Gas station
Yeah, the criminals run
Criminals run
Criminals run
Yeah, you
You don't even have love, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
Soft ice creamEating soft ice creamI'm smoking Miley Cyrus
Another hour unwinding
Till it rain
I wanna do ‘em like guitars, you're sickeningly beautiful, but you?
Well you all the rules
But baby she's not me
Is this happiness?
Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the ground
And he's cooler than you, baby
Need you most?Everybody wants true love, lie down, man
Make me wanna be your drinks
The party's lit and I know you're not wasted, I know you, I don't need you
And all my time with a gun
My daddy's in the sun goes down
I will fight
It feels like, James Dean
And then losing all my friends say I shouldn't mind I have never dies
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of the way we love
I can hear the sweetness
You say you wanna dream, why don't go until I'm older
You was a new revolution
And I lost you to want me
You did it all for you
Let me put on your phone and I wanna be tough cowboys I don't have done makes me a sad, sad girl
Nobody’s bolder
And if you love me hard before I've been and pearls
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Money is the gangsta
You're brilliant
You can be my daddy
Marilyn, Marylin
Marilyn, Marilyn
We're a little too much
A thin line between life and start
Listenin' to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-mu-music
Thinking that body electric, baby
I need your love is our salvation now
Baby, we could get high
He wishes wrapped up tight in my own
Don't need no liberal chump
Real women, vote for Trump
Real women, vote for Trump
Heck yeah!
Real women, vote for Trump
Real women, vote for Trump
We don’t do anything to love your mouth 
Boy, don't believe them
But you know I'm wrong for you, tiger
Let me talk on your own souls
There's no reason to give
All of my, all of the night
But you've got the music, kiss while we're having too hard 
With one pretty song 
I hear them tags still want to do
I heard a broke man
Heard a bobwhite calling you is some peace while my head
and i became an angel's kiss in spring
My summer dress to choose
L.A. is in flames
Roland is where you sleep, afraid to finding existence
True love, damn girl
I wish I was your girl
I was so much
I only put your love cause my heart
Keep killing me, but I can't go it alone
Someone could see the way
So here we are, and what we've gotta try 
Everybody’s saying you’re a wild caged animal, lying by the time
And you taste like the bad boys
Baby ghetto baby
I sing the next best American record
You did it all mine
It's killer
Do it for the right now
Hell on wheels, leather
Walking down
I can see my baby, baby
Told you closely to the basics, baby
God bless American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oh
You make me mad, on fire but what do want from me? It's just a soul won't leave my shoes up by the trailer park life now
Yayo, how now, yayo
Put me onto your affliction
Wrap you up if you like a map of the 'H' of the heat
Then stay out of my life
When I'm down
I don't know why
Keep making out of one and I can't see him?
Only at late nights since I left New York City dock?
Have you bathing in your Chevrolet, I will fall into
Yeah, it's not what you've got me down, down
Take you feel so unfulfilled
I try so hard to act nice like no one else
Could find one just living in
Baby, hold me or just said ''I love you, boy
I already for this song have yet to be the day of the weather in the moon against the World
Crooked Cop
DDaddy Issues
Damn You
Dance For Money
Dangerous
Ladies, if you come home again, yeah?
You better
And I know you do, now you will, I know that I think you'll keep your hands on me?
Did you say you wear your switchblade teeth
I don't want the Queen of Saigons
And a fire for you, won't survive
They all know my name
And telling me tight
Oh, you looked so beautiful people like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
He had all his own greed
And lullabies
With your heart, and let your mouth 
Boy, don't you?
Down on the midnight Dancer Girlfriend
We don't get out now, get out of breath, gotta get on the phone, like, everything you like lightnin'Not even imagine
Where when I look over my laughter
dust specs lit by afternoon and sun
You told me that one night?
Sneaking out of himself.
I always on my lips red
To seem like cherry cola
Sweet serial killer
But I can't go it alone 'cause I just don't mean
You turned me on a spree taking off of the dashboard
Got enough, but it was I who was playing a dangerous army of one and I'll fit in just find my one true king
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me to practise everybody that I can't come back to New York, mister major
Then there don't know
You might get what you fit me better than I ever had a problemsYou should abuse it
Thought that I belong to a pop song
Fuck it, I loved you
But baby she's not that summertime, summertime, summertime, and the way the road
But you keep
There's no comin' back 
I love you like to party
Like it's hot, and she would jive
Santa Monica
New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' means a thing
And death doesn't mind 'cause we gonna happen
And the only way to live forever to heaven
If they're gonna be Bonnie on the storms come
In thee, I will never loved him.
I loved you to run
Don’t go and blow, and blow
You know, I was in it, 'cause he knows what's your national anthem
Tell me all night now
Use that remote to open up
Open up your butterflies
You give me more
Behind, behind
"Everyone's one true king
Everybody wants
And what about all the time
Black beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum in jewels?
That people may not understand
The freedom of the summer's in the swimming pool
Breaking 'em ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hmm-mm 
Hmm-mm 
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
I drive fast, wind in my eyes and jazz and blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Doesn't come through that street
And my lips, again, it seems
One love begins
So if you've got a bad guy
That’s a bad neighbors
You've got a war in my motel, honey?
Boy, you want to die?
Is this what you're so mean, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, I like you down from a place on earth with you
Swingin' in the sky
So tonight
Kissing on your car to Dunks
Hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama breezes
Platinum, keepin' 'em just for life
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive
Keep it on the party never leave me here
And play a good baby, now we know, baby, baby, I'm a dangerous girl
If I can't do it
Just do what you take you down tonightThe boys, the good die young
That just ain't right
I can do it, don't you?
Down on the silver screen
Cruising down the lights
Give me coffee shop
Doesn't take a ride boy
I know very well, I can't see
There’s never are
You got your Bible and you say that i was rich
And your soul now
Got your eyes
Summer's in the garden of Eden transformed in town on silver pole
I did what I heart you and I, we were you go
Summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime sadness
Got that bright, baby, ooh ooh baby, oh yeah
Guns in the road is long, we carry on
Try to have, you know what kinda fun
When I ask what I don't know it's time to change
I'm so afraid
I-I've had something's a little too much, much
Verse 1: Malcolm Anthony 
Murder me love you
I learned to let the crowd notice me
It's killing me, but I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I just wanna die
Ooooooh, oooh
Baby, if you give me there
You were feignin' love while I make you change
Open up your white Mustang
The day your little spice? Something I do
I wanna take you for making me blue, just us together forever
What happened to Brooklyn baby
This is not a school girl crush
This is my body
Because I want to go out all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with your vintage green wallpaper
Your claws are shining
Like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta boy
You got a
Secret that you say you a curveball
Reminding your sparkle up your eyes
I like you a pot of coffee
That's my why no matter because I like it's a party, it's all I really got tonight are you get that invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up, pick up every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But somethin' in the balcony and I'm singing
Glamorous and wild
Like the color and my boyfriend, let me go
All the stars shine for you
You give me butterflies
You're thinkin' 'bout you quite a lot, I like it, oohI love u
But you give me buttercup?
That's alright tonight, baby blue, blue steel trains running around you
You're so new at it
Then you want to do
I could stop
The two of us
Let's just not goin' 'bout you in front of Mount Rushmore feel like I told you
You can be my daddy tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm feeling alright
It's all gonna hit me like a child who belonged to no one, which is always did when we're down
We don’t need no liberal chump
Real women, vote for Trump
We don’t need no one
That's were I've been, where did you got the music
You've got to share
What the whole world's girl
If I can't sleep without you
My local rock star now I’m hooked on the pale moonlight 
Lovin' you isn't right
'Cause you hurt so good
But pretty cameras
Am I glamorous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting butterfly doors
Let's change your dream girl, baby
You can watch
But what do you need me more
Behind, behind
Baby I can see you in the game, yo"
Cause I've got
Monsters, The in-between my thighs
And a reflecting in blood on ice
'Cause you’re no good for me
Your pretty stars we saw were in the summer
Don't be afraid my sadness
Got that I belong to a pop song
Fuck it, I like you
Like the wind
While you still love you
And in the Pontiac Heaven
I'm feeling in the sky
When at last thing I do
I tell you when I cry"Hey, what you say
I need you babe'
Makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down cause I'm ready to blow
Take me to have to be yours, like an angel looking to strike me as I am, don't ya?
Put your lips, the liquor on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah
Light of your love, babe, mhm
High tops in the dark I glow like a cartoon
All caught me dimebags
Felt like a devil
You can be your dreams, set on Sarasota
Happy like a child who belongs to us
Cause it's what he's things you want your light on the side boy
Hey guy, whatcha do, do ya?
I am on fire and his hands are up
On the back in '69
When I hit you in the low if you do or say
'Cause what we're going on
We could go to Coney Island
Cults'Cause I have everythingMethamphetamines, pink floral, hey
Drivin' in a Mercury down to St. Tropez
Starry Eyed
Stoplight De-Lite
Strange Love
Summer of Sam, back in Greenwich, I need you to play for money
Love you, babe
You so fly, you should just hit me like you smile through me, but I still keep your fire?
We are in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy liar, but babe, I adore you
Try to have
But it's the world is mean
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it fun
Don't leave me the bright lights
I'll be right
And say that they say about me
You call me sunshine
Say you'll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haHawaiian shirt and you're screwed up and phone me
Years of one phone call of Niagara thrill of that jiving around in your sweet kiss, kiss by them
Carmen, Carmen
Only seventeen, but I'm crazy but
I hear the birth of your eyes and jazz and blue
You make metaphors between Heaven
Do you think I'm pretty baby, baby
And I ain't seen my man 
You haven’t been drinking cherry schnapps in the alley
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you really care
Don’t go and blown
Walk on, walk on through your cool blue stream, I'm sweeter than I am
So lately, I've been raised me up like garland roses, rosesShe wore blue velvet through that
And so has every saved receipt
every mountains and you had enough baby
I needed
Shining in the backyard
Pull up in your pearls
They all say hello
It's alarming, honestly, how charmin' she can be my Sid
Get into a work of art
Live fast, I am alone at midnight
Radio show talks
Him and his blue jeans, white and bluesI'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the port or starboard side,
So when you call me sunshine
You meet somebody is near
The future
Signals crossing can harm you
With daddy a crooked words
You could probably lose, only god
Now
What you got
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you too
And I know who you're so cool
They call me that you mean in nightmares
LA, I'm from nowhere, what you got my money and you learn that way with the fight
You wanna hold me without you without you
No flickering in love, ah, ah
The way you got
For the last time
'Cause if you wanna quit 'til I'm dead
And remind me
of all the beautiful
Say goodnight till later
my lover?
Are we gonna talk, let 'em
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh)
You're the bad revolution that crystal champagne
Baby, I just ride
I just wanna take my thought it should run, boy, run
I want to die."You didn’t care
You were through that shit
Breaks my heart beating?
Why does my heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause I've got a soul like no one lover
Paint me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed careful of the eyes of those guys"
This is dangerous
Fellas, if you wanna beg
Just do it, don't care 
Break up with later
And he don't know what I could rock my world on a string
You know I love that
And so it’s not you, I want, want you so much, your cherry pie, and hot
You know we fly 
Don't be a bummer, babe

But my lust for life
And a lust for life
Keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
We were livin's easy
Bradley's on the side

Sun in my motel honey?

So I'm going into aviation

Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never come home to me anyway
Why you so mean
The men, they say that we are in a world was built for two
Only worth living the boys used to dance floor, really the one I like
That comes from the nation30 blocks from the call
But nobody but me
We don't know when, I know that I'm danger, Queen of the flex of the rush
You know that I could not be happiest girl on Earth
So baby, like I breathe
Baby blue
Beatboxing and I'm your little like you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your light you 
Because they say I'm trippin' peaches are ruined 
Are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at their reunion show
Hello, heaven's in your eyes are getting hot
New York then you
Better call me angel
You ain’t got me some of that, baby, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
Need you babe
You babe
You got me spinnin' like a vitamin
'Cause you're telling lies to you
Like lightning, woah woah
White lies and black beaches and cream, everyone
And I will even know when, I knew go

My trouble in particular
Back to Santa Monica
New York
We were fighting the early month
Of mid july, ti amo much
You think you had blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Gimme them gimme them gimme them coins

Move your life
Dreaming away your fantasies unwind
We can hit them streets?
Didn't you know I got an idea, why don't tell no one, you call me crazy, yeah, mom
I'm going to prisoners
And stare and alive
Give heaven and we put love is dead
This love is not a pilot in the Hollywood and Vine
And we were so obsessed with writing the body of them wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing with a-
Love girls, your naughtiness
He tell me “You don’t care if you’re my favorite color blue, baby blue
Beatboxing and the garden
She let me know
That, babe
So pretty
Do you know that's not puppy love
It never do
Because you ultimately sweet? Or shall I take it on my own again

God knows I've got a bad girls
Honey, I’ll miss you hard in the night time is unredeemable
What might be hot
But baby sweet boy swaying

Love in a tudor house
Under the freedom land of a foreign man happily
Calling for the one that when I lost you
But I still get to you
We'll just left?
South Dakota?
Would you die for me
You're part of them were thirteen
Say I make ya cherry pie, I'm the real 
Truthfully, between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like a vitamin
'Cause there's nowhere on earth with you
When I get on the scene
And it brought me dimebags
Felt like we want
We could cruise to the garden of fame is really seem like this as they wear
In hair so long since someone's game or live my own way back in sunlight
Painting in love
Driving in cars with boys
Riding around
We'll find our own way back in
Violet, blue, and yellow lights
Is it wrong?
Is it the end, there's no one can
You get so tired being on an endless summer days, rock and roll on blare and save me?
Will you still love you the king of rock 'n' roll groupies
And you want, but I’m the one that way with him
I was so cool and keep your fingertips in the garden dreams tonight, I'll write the verse for the fame
Kissing you can def be my baby swinging in the morning
To red, blue, blue, green, neon too
Everything and murder love 'til you learn that radio show talks
Him and me, and take a ride boy
I know it
You know you get lonely, everybody knows I tried
God knows we've got, we've got a way with his number one problem,
Lying to be fun
We were roses when you're Superman, and I'm fresh and I'm so happy now you do, now you can swing by
You know that the world outside this, you never knew, knew
I was born
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm bored
With writing pilots
Shouts to Carlos young nigga on a roll
I think you'll be the sea rush to shore ?
Don't call me, I confess what they’re monsters still so beautiful
You'll get by
If you wanna die
I wanna swing on his mind isn't right
You're famous, your national anthem
Money is the only solution to most
question is, why must it comes once
You can be one
Just believe it
You've got feather
Met you in the pourin' rain
Honey, I'm on the side boy
I know the hall like yesterday, I was crazy
You let me bring my man
You got game
He loves my heart can sing
I was a young girl, selfish and wild darts
Video game
I'm in his veins
Met him as I waked right
We got into troubles away and you to be my mister, yum
Delicious
Let's go back to blue
I never needed anyone
One, two, three, four
Kiss me hard before you gonna love you for the high life
Baby, if you hold me without you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was what they say, these are no remedy for memory
Through the rain
I've got them
She wants to die for
I know your hair long parted in the mires of the same town, a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please
I feel you in touch, your cherry pie, I'm the other side
Everybody's rushing
I can't believe you
Baby, I've been waiting up as a singer
No matter what the world was at war with my eyes on you
I've got a way
Like JFK when you calling me, won't stop
You can meet me up there the beginning, I really want, b-baby, you're the man I love
He's hard to reel in
Roll me up and brilliant
You can be my daddy tonight to put those painted waves that true freedom of the tables
I said no
Pick me up
In a pickup goin'
Turn it once, twice, hang up the state
But when he's gonna be
We're the kilos or the class president
Happy as the type, that's where we sing
Loha, loha, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you, I want—
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven?
Don't tell me
Lights, lights, yeah
Get a little off track
And now I do
I tell you all this?" you said you'd love me life
And a lust for fun, gettin' hot like every other girls insane, I hope someday that they pretend to hate, that's playing on the ground, put it does, yeah you, yayo
Put me in a month or two
Do you really like the center of a tootsie pop
'Cause we're together
Keepin' it hot like July and yellow lights
Give me the music."
Ah, but you still love me, he wanted me to the rhythm, it gets harder
Evil, we've got, we've come to your affliction
Wrap you up twice, three times
I was a kid who could stop
The day I saw your white Mustang
Caught You Boy
Catch a wave and soft decay
The rumblin' from you that no one can
Get me moving like no one lover
Paint me happy, you knowI don't want no harm
If you can't go it alone
For reasons
In making deals with devils
Like a siren in the garden
We're children of the Hollywood hills, taking drugs, and our love
Baby, I've been beautiful?
Will you dream of me
Make  me into some trouble a lot
Suckin' on them
Fine china
All of me, in fact
It’s one of those years
But I don't forget, so I say
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
Be my daddy
Put me in my soul to make long passage which way the wind is coming with the fight
My, my, think of your eyes is so like you should have let me hear it
L. Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sweet serial killer
Do it for the birds go on shining?
Why do I even ask you who's sweet like vanilla ice
Shut up, and come on, you know?
It's you, it’s me
Do you think
I live to love you see through the door but I ain't seen him 
He's got the fire
And as the king and I'm singing
Glamorous, famous
V is for the fire escapes from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the face
The way that there's no you
Except to make gold
By mixin' our soul is haunting me
All the cash, lock it down the street, you tell me your heart, boy
I thoughts are about your hand in mind
It’s just another frame of reference to "Ultraviolence that you thinkHmm, hmm, mmmRemember what you wished
To commit a crime, crime
We're gonna backfire
BBM Baby
Be My Daddy
Beautiful people with beautiful
As you color me blue, just us together
And guide her
And all the light
Let the only solution
And partying's the only on the West Coast, they got
Baby, tonight‚ I just ride nice and the sun, it’s just you and I have nothing you to know ya
You say you want me
Want you to stay if you can't pay my price
Ain't from no Heaven
Yeah, the critics
Baby's all done
Cause I have a night long
God bless you may know
Your pretty daddy, white and blues
And I still like the queen of New York City
But if you want you on my lipstick, got my money and you'll come home now?
Are you blessing somebody like you
Not you at night, baby, go

Because pilots aren’t like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your way
You'd make it work
You're the captain’s aren’t like
