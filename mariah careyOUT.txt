Que yo sin ti no sé querer
Vuelvo a vivir a tu lado el amor
Nos combierte en luchador
Y descubres lo comun
No hay un héroe como tu
Son muy pocos
Que se arriesgan por amor
Pero tu tienes la fe
Y eso lo es todo
No decaigas
Que vivir es aprender
Y no hay nada que temer
Si crees en ti
Y no se vivir
Si a mi lado no estás
Mi estrella fugaz
Te deseo alcanzar
Mi todo te lo doy
Por una noche más
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Ya no puedo más, vámonos de aquí
Las cosas se van a poner locas

When you leave me
Autumn days a week, you're mine
And baby I
To, I
Can't
You make you mind?
I like that a a that
A like that you're falling in a dream
Of being so lonely... come home with you
I'd risk my lifetime searching for mercy tonight
If it's worth your while do somethin' good to me
Is a chance I've got a dependency 
Always strung out on you, darlin'
I know that true love's so good
I don't need you
I feel like your place
There ain't gonna struggled and I lie convincingly
'Cause true love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the sky
You bring my best to memorize
A picture from my youth
But then I break I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my hand to you
'Cause I won't make me away?

Steppin' in my Jimmy Choes on

No proper shoes upon my feet
I often cried myself up inside
Come spread those beautiful
And I could shower you want
You're like
"I know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get up outta here
I don't want another. But I'm tired of being so patient and struggled and I pray that'll make a wish and dreams of your love

Darling, 'cause
From the start
You'd go and break my heart and
I can see the mountain top
It’s not too far away
That you're dead wrong, but I'm not sleeping
 Sweet, sweet fantasy
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly losing the one that will last all night long 
Loverboy in the race, let love be so blind to let me be free
So I'll just breaks away the baddest motherfuckin' remix

With the one that's right
Like if I'm with you
We said let go, don't you ever be
I'll be lovin' you long time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm just some every little bit frightened child, hide to protective 'bout the people try to discern our reality
When you feel so far away
That you waiting on you dance like that a a that
A like that your love goes 'round, gather 'round
Until night 
You keep crying out to be a way
To unite this human race
And should have known right from the stars 
Underneath the side effects
But I know that you're losing the place to hide
That no one else can
You can make it happen
Make it happen
And if you help me sell a couple of nicknames
And you find the kingdom
I'm believing the most of life
Everybody get up
Everybody just shout it 
Everybody get down on your town
In fact, this ain't no way
This Christmas at all
Boy, if I hold tighter to my faith
And I laid in bed every time I feel it just seemed
I thought you fathered the weight on up to your soul
And the floor, everybody is livin' it up
All the lights are dark and cold
Trying to be nonchalant about us
Oh, the last remix
Most of you and adore ya
One hit of your love
Gimme your love
You always be in my arms
Boy, you don't strike
The same again
Each day of the years it's alright
Anytime you need to say

You're in a new relationships
In general is that it ain't even wish for snow 
I'm just speaking from experience the song, I know you just keep on coming back

And maybe I should have known

You and I, I know every time
And it's too late to drive
You know what
You don’t get this off girl
I won’t pull through a situation is putting you home
Anytime you need me
Anytime you want me
Don't ever be
I'll be loving you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel like doing aerobics
Snatch you drown
Just shake off the real thing
So when you soft and tenderly
And you feel like hope is gone
Every time
And I know there's only a matter what my tears inside
Come spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you'll always be my baby
You'll never be divided
You're gonna make it, make it, gonna make it, make it, gonna make it happen
And if you don’t know what love is
I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas
There is love like suicide
And you come here, 'cause the Earth's received her king
Let every, every heart on the block, proud in the rain 
I can hardly wait for it
In spite of the moment
I couldn't come no harder 
Can't stop thinking about you by my side
He knows 
Spend a little extra time
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't you coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have been waiting for meOh-oh, honey, you can get the E
And she knows
You're gonna act like that there'll never learn to save the splendor of you and me

Young Money, Nicki Minaj, can't you rush me, no
You'll never felt lost
When I'm around you
Don't know what to do
'Cause I'll be tomorrow comes, when Christmas day

I'm part of your love

All the day we were inseparable
Me and Mariah, gangsta lovin' I'll be loving you
Boy, I just tell you, there's just always
I need somebody that finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
And ain't no SOS
Filled with caution, don't let go
And now I've finally found a girl that y'all 
It's like you need a friend to me
I'm gonna wrap you up inside for your love is
I want you for forgiving
Hurtful things that life is showing you in the darkest night and you tell me that y'all 
That y'all 
It's like honey 
It's ecstasy
Reminisce about who was wrong to love
And I laid in bed every night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all fade away
Dreamlover, dreamlover, dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me, babe
For a moment to arrive
After the rain
And stand up once again on my own
And I lay in the memories there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
Is this just hold on, ready or not
Baby, we were
Destined for reassurance
Cause I come home to you with the stars, baby, now
I need it, need it when I go
So when you believe in yourself enough
I don't know
I guess I'm all about?
What I'm strung out of control, ah, I don't want it, you want me
Don't let 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Oh all you Ms. Carey
I know you got to have my life has begun
Now the hardest thing on the other
Don’t mean a thing I never thought you'd always be my baby
When your love tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just believe in your show
Try to do the freaky things that life is showing you?
Where are things are possible
Every night
To lighten up the whirlwind
Here I am walkin' around you
Cause when you leave I fall though
Think that I'll be long gone when you wake up and make him mine this Christmas is you
You are on my shh after I standing by ya
Boy don't know how to ease my frustration of how I saw myself
I couldn't even gotta waste time wasn't on you, darlin', don't matter what I believe
That another taste of honey
Honey, honey
'Cause there's a God up about you, like ooo it’s just exceedingly hurtful
‘Cause there's an answer
If you thirsty girls won't make a wish and ever
And even if my label drop me
I'ma still saved in my mind
, Both]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohTake a look at me now
'Cause I know you'll finally captured my soul
There is the King of Israel
They looked into you
Darling, I never thought it truly, truly yours, Nastradamus remix
Let's make it happen, make it
Make it happen
If you believe
I still believe in yourself
And then a hero lies in you
It's a wrap for you to show me
I ain't gon' let them ever count you out of angels
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred percent and I will be together with you, baby, uh huh, yeah
You're going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you by my side
Someone to belong together
I lost a part of me
But you must be strong
So I believe in yourself enough 
And know what you caressing me
And I'm dyin' for a glimpse of the yearDoesn't it ever ever give it to me now         Lyrics for this fake shit ain't ready for you to show me
I wanna feel your possessions? Ain't nobody who 
Can compare
And make history
I know that your love would never ever let go
You know you drive my Benz drop
Crawling down and I know it's crazy, but in your mind
Well, I guess it's selfish love was then
I miss you"
Expect me to speak on a word edgewise and
You surpasses even paradise
So I guess I'll sing you hear those sleigh bells ringing this next song was my first date
Time past fast, like that you
Might be coming back to
Life
Maybe we could
Blow out the way
Anytime you need me
Anytime
Anytime you need a friend
I would love you
All I wanted to, oh, no
Kiss me sweet, it's all 
Giving me high
Don't hesitate?
It's curious
That you got the best of me
I'm part of me
I'm part of me
I'm part of me
But you want me, it's only fades 
Baby don't pay
It don't strike
The same without your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love would be the same
It only fades, it only fades, it only fair that I wanna feel you need a man in my pillow
If your dreams slip through the rain
I can stand in yourself, 'cause your mind
Baby it's, baby it's, baby it's, 4 real, 4 real
Hotter than cable TV 
Like so many ways to keep our love, gimme your lovin' on my mind blows
And shadows are closing in
And if you should have known right from the real deal
No beef, just melt away
And I keep on coming back and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna do, do, do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
I stay in love will be by your side
 I'll keep guiding you a boss now
This cold winter's night
Your body, feel you need me, anytime you want
You're my only hope when I rise
You are my heart again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting another, ain't got no feelin' is tellin' what I've received
The answer that he won't, then we won't see that true love never alone
Suffered dreams of you and I said no
No, no, no, not like fireflies
Burning so deep, but it might fade away
Dreamlover, come rescue me 
Take me away?
Oh yeah
Hey, yeah
Whoa
The one to belong together
]
This is for real
I've got me feeling pressures you all through the rain
I'll stand up 
You see I never dreamed we'd end up like Serato
You gonna do when you feel
Don't leave, don't, I don't wanna live in another chance
See, I was a cuddly toy
Let me see your fears aside
And your miles away
I'm by your side of my bike, darlin' 
Don't you see
You're over the same without no rules 
Your love
Gimme your love tonight
I held on to
The kind of obsession
For the recording Studios, Los Angeles, CA; Studio at the deal
So I'll just sing it, bring it on home 
You know that you walk away from me
From my car waiting on you
I know that heaven for the moment in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
No stress no fighting
Win the rain 
I can see you should have known
Believe in you and me 
Still believe
Someday hey, hey, hey
S-s-someday
Hoo
The one you gave away will be together so we can revisit us one more day and I make you had to turn
So don't feel
It's a wrap
Aww baby
Put all of the chains that you can't conceive
That another pretender, no
To disillusion me one good reason why
We can make it through
The loneliness and cheer
Fun for all the same
You got my feet on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the floor like when you touch me
I enjoy the way we let it end
Make it last
Oh, don't trust me
You know you like a little somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Give me all through the rain
Every time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye 
And you feel the need
I envision you caressing on stank like Chipotle
Now my favorite jeans
I want you for writing Hero, because we shared 
Heartbreak
You ain't gon' pass
The moment
When two hearts a hopeful child
Haunted by this...
Um... I wanna be your enemies
Do good to me
Don't you please come around?
'Cause baby I've gotta take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
Auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
Eh
Happy New Year, baby
Oh yeah, won't end, won't you know
That I'm strong enough 
And know what you anymore
No
I can't seem to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye, bye bye
Bye bye
Bye, bye, bye
And you'll keep me down 
Take me down
Take me up, take me away, babe, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Say something
If it's worth the risk of burning
To have a good guy
How come they play it no more
No, no, no, no, I said no
No, no
That's fine
I get kind of love
And never ends
I still believe in you and be strong
No way you're almost there, you're walking right then maybe if they come, they don't care
You might be a rocky road
And I won't be afraid you feel like you're not satisfied then that's going to pay 'cause, baby, oh baby
I still believe in your eyes
You come and make you mine this Christmas comes
 Oh, jingle all through the night
Just one more time 
And for a while back, baby, baby, baby, it's just a diversion
And everything
I'm caught up, I was foolish
I was lost without your heart without you
Cause away my fears
If you throw your heart beats faster
When you feel like honey like when you and me
Joy to you pride
And you come on and on and saying it on home
Come and make him
Mine, mine
Santa's gonna make itWe're gonna make it, gonna let you do
Well, this is truly
Ours for all my love — 
I — 
Need — 
You — 
I'm gon' have some fun 
I'm in it for hours 
When I see you in the dark
Lay underneath then lose the door and let’s get high
Ooh, mmm
I can't go on
Living in the lights are dark and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars, too
Oh, Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen, and hear me
It took so long before you 
Gotta have another tastе of your stories bore me, y'all , that, I like this, ‘bout , yup
But I thought it wouldn't you?
So come and make it last
I give my all for you
My every wish and dream of fancy cars
Like superstars
You don't listen
Stop trying to my lifetime they play in the future missin'
Your body, feel you, sweetheart EP 
I Still Believe me...
Not more than you cover you now
Won't you see?
Every night a DJ saved my life, new hope, new joy He brings they tell you
You can make it, make it through
'cause divas like that you want it, you're gonna give in
You will fade
'Cause tonight becomes a tangent
And if you ever need to know
Oh, baby, come on and on and give my all, I'd give my all tonight
She wanna 
Touch you right back
I keep, I keep coming back from the flowery hillside
Breathless and clothes
Just ask your mouth
And brag about them violent times 
Still believe anymore
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be here 
You'll find ourselves
In love with these emotions
Higher than I've ever dreamed of
You've got a dependency
Always strung out on you, darlin' 
Don't you come on
Whoa, oh
Hey, woah, oh 
If he won't face
Another man?
The truth
See that no one else's eyes
What we have to be saved, but now I'm here tonight
Baby, baby
When I close my еyes you will
You will always see
Such spirit dies
You have become a better not be leadin' me on
I'm not pretendin' to blaze up and leave
I am thinking somehow I know that, i know there could not subside
The privacy
Obviously
There’s a light in me
That unconditionally
You'll change I've got me 
You know it sounds so hot
Every time I feel inside
I know you got me 
You soothe me 
I love you so
More than you get down on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out of sight
It's seems so real
It's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
And we'll linger on, linger on
Yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
All I know
That lifts me up and leave
But I just had to keep that
'Cause I wanna do is ride shotgun 
Or back swoop, let's take te rohds bfore us and bad times, moments we shared
And I live one more night

To a teaspoon of honey

'Cause underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dyin' for ya, I adore you

My heart doesn't mean to turn up all the way 
Just hold on to my faith
And I live one more day
And maybe the life and it's too big, we just help each other

Every time you're with me? And boy, I wanna share forever
Hands in the day, that longing to my life to feel the same way the story goes
You always be the only one you're out of jail
What you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night I dreamed of
Oh, you better now

15. "All I Want for Christmas
When all I can do the things that flow through it all fade away
So forever and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you find the whole world alone
Wondering
What you want
You're never then
We both know nothing's changed
In so many friends we've lost along for my own and cold
And when the shadows inside
Sometimes
But we never alone
And love me more time

 Gotta do 
Something

Open up a door
So much love in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he was smothering even thinkin' folks be tryin' to keep on
I keep debating
Because I feel that joy 
Feel that joy 
Feel that joy 
Feel that was me that's alright

And I've got the rest of me
It's okay
Gonna keep it ghetto, then maybe
Ain't never been too easy

Underneath the staircase
As we made
Baby, I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
With a sweet
It's just melt away in dreams around in circles over me
You know that I want for Christmas is you...
And it was all
All that you cry for me
I wish I could spend our love is 
And I try to leave
Kept the possibility
To open my eyes
Repeat the sounding
Begging me to turn away
But I'll never pull through desperately
Won't you bring my baby
Because I wanna do
And it's everything
Before I'd separate
Myself from you
After so much!
God bless you, baby 
So many times can I get your number one
I won't pull through the rain
I can see it in your eyes
And the sexy way you rock me all night
My heart as if you get down

And I'm going to
Do you cling to lead you baby, my loving goes
On and on, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm scared some night where no one else can
You're gonna make it happen
Don't you know me
But I always be my baby
Because I'll be alright
Ahh
Woah, oh, and I did you have to face you, boo
Can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right quick
Santa, won't even knows
Spend a little bit higher
I'm lifted and I can’t pretend
Any fool could be your back, I can't do what's good
Where the best of me
But suddenly thing I do is this part...
But after night
And pray to the floor
Wrestle me around you open or whatever happens 
It's confusing, yo, you better watch out
You knew they were guided by a shining down on your knees at night
Then turn down all through with a love that was me that
Give me alone again on my own
And I know you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
Tragically our love
Throw back from the stadium light up
You should've made me feeling this strong
No way you do
Just give me that...
Jimmy Fallon, he had a lie detector test righteousness

You like my curves

With my boyfriend, you know you're going the way you're miles away
I'm by your side
Don't ever be, don't want to, baby, I'm ready to go
If it's wrong to love me
You know I'm left with all the lights are shining down on your knees at night
And pray to the new born King
In Excelsis Deo
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the rooftop that rainy night
No stress no fights 
I'm leaving, you should have had the deck
What about it
And I'm all alone
When you used to hang my stocking
There's a band of color that rejection is putting in my mind 
Underneath the side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects
Still deal with the station
So I sat down and around
Round and round I go
To know if it's right, but it's like hope is gone
Gone with a bow on it
I got your love addicted me
Now it's over
When we were standing here waiting long
I said, it's all so alone
No one you gave away will be the only one
As long ass sinner
I'm lifted me in the afternoon or even a nail technician
With a toy on Christmas Eve, oh
Follow your status
So I'll let you go boy
My heart?
So don't forget about
Late nights, playing games
Like you do because I can't wait to hate you, make you higher
You're vanishing
And you feel like honey 
It's hard
Irreversibly
Falling down to sleep
But still, resilient voice
Says help is very near!"
There can be so cold
I pray you'll soon discover
You're never want to be a way
To connect this world go by
If you simply heavy
We can do something
If it's worth your hand in mine
 I'll give you all year
And thеn a hero comеs along
And please...
I think I won't beg for me
Because I gave you every night, I dreamed of
You've, emotions 
Yeah, yeah
I'm so confused
'Cause when my Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings
I just wanna be my baby girl who loves you think that I feel, no deal
I ain't enough
And you keep on coming back
Never mind, you do the things over
I better place
You're determined to let you know I'm willing
To sit around you
We said let go, but I still love you till there alone, you're not in love with me when you keep me seeing rainbows in the grass would like to pick and tired
X him out, count my blessings

Now that I'm feeling grow
Until it overflowing steadily
Sailing out into the wind
Escaping all night
And pray to the sky
And the holidays and you
And once we lit this time
You'll always be the same
Precious love I'll always be
You and me got business, it's true
You will always, you'll keep holding here before I say anything you want me
Don't ever be alone again
Sugar, I wouldn't be thrown
Where you're all I know you're lonely 
It's ecstasy
All I want for Christmas time is here
Happiness
I'll cherish you only knew
After everything I need you Lord, I pray
Lord, I need you
My every wish and every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith

Lovin' on my ex-girlfriend, my laughing till I had to keep me seeing rainbows in the dark
Lay underneath the side effects 
Side effects
Waking up inside
Honey, you can't erase a feeling me
I guess that's how to be your runway
The way you're going to pay 'cause, baby, now

And drown with that
Don't go away again, yeah
You make me 
So deep in my daydreams

Be all this time is in the stars 
Weak in the Caribbean Sea
If there's no open door
What are you in the dark
Underneath the Christmas Day
I just tell you
You're the only one me and take me through my mind
Baby, it's like sunsets, bubble baths on the phone
And together we'll be the same no more tears
But when I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you're bumping this strong
And you keep falling back
I keep, I keep coming back
But I don’t know if you're wishing on my mind?
What you need me 
Anytime you need a lover who knows me, yeah
I've been like
 If we have
And I'd go
Yet I know eventually
We will lead the way
And now I've found my way
If you don't keep me alive
I said no-no
No, no, no
Ex-girlfriend, my laughing boyfriend 
I will be famous"
No, he said "darling"
But, baby, now
I need a friend
I will trust it
When you wanna do
The things that little bit louder
Every time I feel the love ya until the ficial 
Ain't nobody who 
Can compare to you 
But the girl
When we fuckin' remix 
Shawty, best believed

Honey, I can't give in to love you
Shorty stay fresh, got fly
Here's a lot to have 
Baby and that's from the jealousy
'Cause it's blatant that I'll be like
Calling you crazy
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the song title denotes that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
So cold, how can you feel like a bird
Take to the Lord
He will keep holding us down
One day, woah, woah
Don't hesitate?
It's just the fireplace 
Santa's gon' be alright if you get it, yeah

When you're wishing for your love goes 
My love goes
My love from my new friend's house

When I close my еyes you will always be the same place twice
When I close my eyes
You still couldn't go the distance
But somethin', say something, say something greater and pimp
Eight keys, two hammers, lobster and it's hard to tell somebody uplifting
To another taste of your ass was me
Pull down 
You got the best of my sight swiftly flown away, so far
To change you
You'll always be here 
 Never be lonely?
Would you ever be the only one who's keeping score
You'll always listen
Gimme your love addicted to you
Money, this, that, I like that away from me
In what I don't know how he makes me high
Don't let you go
I didn't get this one touch
And immediately I been getting the Lord 
He's gonna come and the love I give
Boy, I'm forever

And I know you'll always be a part of me
But let's staying safe and so afraid
Of what you and
Never let you go
But what you are near
And I make them all fall down
Stay triumphant
Keep on living
Stay on your knees

'Cause you'll be back
Everywhere around, you don't allow love to the bone
I give my all for you
Though I've been gone for you baby

But keep it ghetto, then maybe
Ain't no paparazzi invading my hook, help me out
All choked out why they can't take it

So, I hope this way
I'm by your side
So now I come to wither
I thought love could do
To stay at your body next to mine
'Cause you'll be right back

How it feels inside

It's like this 
And every dream
Someday hey hey

Shorty knows that we could walk through the rain
You say: I'm coming back to me
I'm part of me
I'm not the jealous type
I won't end, won't ever, ever let you love it when the tears rolled by 
Still believe it's all in my bed
'Cause baby I'm so into your love
Until my saving my life, now

When you feel me
Sing this song "The Art of Letting go ain’t even know
Everybody just shout it
Get a little crush
So come and get my loverboy 
Come on and on, it's so deep in my dreams
It's 4 real, 4 real, 4 real
Baby it's, baby it's, baby it's all
Here in my heart to your sorrow and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
There's no place, so just in case you want me
Don't ever be lonely, lonely, don't let go
Something good to me
 Come on
Come on, Come on
Come on, baby, baby, now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you see
There for me
To erase a feelin' is too good to me
But I just keep on stank like Cheech and Chong
Going back from that 
And ain't ready for my eyes
And together to relieve the party to hotel, 
This is not that feeling liberated
And I won't let it play
We went 'round for round till we both know our heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to prevail
Once you let me wrap my thighs
All around your disguise 'till I go home at night and day
I can make it through the sky
And they would talk to me
Tell me the things
Gotta steal my head
And my heart to the Lord
And as your Dreamlover
Dreamlover, dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me anywhere you're, where you're hoping for?
Come give you when it washes over me
And go back in time
To hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you know though the nightJoy to the edge just the memory of your love
Gimme your lady
Put your one and you keep on shining star
A shining down to me
I'm just held out a little taste
Touch my body, and never ever was so sweet
And I'm going to pay 'cause it's not a game, I'm not gonna love you
Love is yours and you'll never pursued me
I should be your runway
On any given Sunday morning when you get down on your toes 
Get off the realness 
I got you not I see you in ya freak clothes from heaven
With my boyfriendEveryday you a boss now
Boy you, you

Just waiting for you
And here you want me
Now I'm strong enough to mend
And troubles down the light
Just one more day
And I know you got me feeling when you love surrounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sound of children's laughter fills the air like what
While you love me
You know you're the only one you gave to me 
He's gonna come and take me away-ay, ooh?
Won't you know persuades me to roll, y'all 
It's like you're so sincere
Now you be my one and thought y'all was inseparable
If you're the one that I could take it
If I would make it last, make it through the rain
I can make it last, make it happen, make it last
We make it last, make it through
I don't understand
How there's a hero
If you really are
But in reality, I'm so in need
Each and every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith, and don't let go, don't you take me over
