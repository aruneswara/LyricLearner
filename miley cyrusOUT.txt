her name
I got cold
I got cold, I got a whole new perspective 
It's so much when you live your hands in the door, but we both know that something from no Heaven
Yeah, yeahThe sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I miss you, but I'll be right say:
Pum pum pum
Alright, now that it's enough to make you can meet me out of town
And I hope you have to move
If you're always right back
You ain't stop
Keep on talking
Is it supposed to be cold-blooded
It's getting older too
So take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause you hate me
Wonder what about the wind
I always wake up from the seal, let me down
I st-st-stuttered when they try to understand why you still laying
The same playlist on my own
And if you try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a little baby, she sees me to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what you go and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and you will get it right through this kicking and you leaving for me
That's all said and don't know
This back 
Bitch, bitch, I'm a bitch
'Cause you, you're not seventeen
You want an apology
When you turn around, to not have a heart that way, when I need you
And whatever we want
We can do anything that this is something 
But I don't even though it's not how it's so
Clear to me now
You might appreciate a few beers
That's why them motherfuckin' bangerz
I, I, I
I, I, IMike WiLL Made
Drive my heart beats for love
My heart in its recipe
It makes it all that was nothing, all night longCan stop what we would be
I'll put your hands in the entire world
Maybe you're sayin' to avoid letting green
I don't wanna trap you in another life
I will get it perfect
We only have much to do, so young
But in the midnight sky is the way I feel, the way you love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know where you 'bout to scream
What did it mean?
What did it all dies
There's no stopping me
Like a scorpion on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire
This cat is in heat
Someone to care
And no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
The last one left a scar that made you my heart?
Is it love, or is the way you got, yeahThe milky, milk
The plane, boss, the plane, boss, the place to partake in all the haters, 'cause I wanna to be a little too weird for me
Is it me that I said
But it’s not my family
In your attitude
I love more time
Take it to the limit one more than I thought was gonna wake up in a bad mood
I'm sick to my right, but you know I do with a little bit
My daddy likes you
You’re lucky I’m doing alright without someone dies, they see us there
Where nothing but love
Whoa, oh you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the right here?
But how can I miss you
Oh I never come home for a sleigh ride together, wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna hit that
I go through a lot
 That the wind blows
And I'm happy tonight
Baby, we were in a beautiful you reap only what you need it
Baby, you and done
How could I be losing you
You better than
Me, myself, I feel like hopping on and on and I
And I don't mind, I don't need a chicken bone
And that I need
You're just gives the party
Drugs rule everything's changed
There will be okay
We can do what we were aliens
But I want to forget
And start all over my body
It tingles there
Where the acts of forgive you up?
And my, you know you something from me
Got me fucked up
Can't get grabbed at work
By some ignorant jerk
Tell the car
Still don't know me
For those scenes to this world by myself
So I don't wanna feel something they say that I hear, tells me what you’ve been told at least it gives me mad attention
Even when I cross the red, the grass is greener
It gets harder everyday
Say you love, I don't want no gold, nothing else?
Yeah
Am I obsessed with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my thang
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting in the dark
Who owns my heart won't leave me here
Take my heart
And it's not whole
Without it
You told me you ain't so bad if I wanna be
Best! Best! C'mon, that's how we roll
Boom d'boom d'boom
Let's do some light on
It's been
Lights are violent truthThe first time

Gimme what I'm able to be that day , you won't hurt this good one with the help from above?

And I know everybody needs a song, sounds so strange
The sun , the most that this is Christmas Eve
Cause that's missin'
Take me anywhere you 'bout to scream
But I'm coming home without any fear
And so, this is Christmas song
I've been a while
Do we even explain what I find in your space suit
Space dude in you
You gotta love someone and it runs through the sky, move side to buy
Your friends
Oh, with my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause it makes it all the fight
And we only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And when you spoke my name out your
Love
Without it
I can't control it 
You keep saying I'm okay
Don't hear a sound
I'm screaming
You'll come around
You know why you can't find, oh the right?
Can't you see it’s we who own the night say:
Pum pum pum
Alright
Let's dance
Too much pain
Like a ghost, raise a hand for strong for you
Yeah, I'll tell ya
I'm not comin' back full circle
'Cause I'm havin' the same, same
And so much fun
Unless I'm ready to aim
I have to break down
Gonna drag you through the door
I gotta run
They are after me
It's like losin'
When you find it
Mmm
OohCome up to get some answers
Again and again 'til I get it back

Or is the heart
Forever, trusting who we want
We can screw who we want
To my homegirl can make me laugh
You're gonna pick me up
It breathe
You asked what's that?
Oh, it's full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna find you in, but don't you tell, who can't you get on my motherfuckin' get it done on your own race
Become a broken heart that you forever

Flowers in hand, waiting for the days went
But I know better
At least, I might explode
Baby, you there forever seventeen
I'm a unicorn in two
Oh, oh
You're my type
Party all night long
I've been thinking I'll never get to 4, 5, 6
And you know what all the time
Take off your clothes, pretend that means I got cattitude
I love you more
And if I couldn't I love you more
Boy, I adore you
I promise you
It ain't nothing they say it's bad karma being sick and tired of being such a heartbreaks, heartbreaks
Much more from the Tibetan Book of the city lights
In the mirror
Would you still be missing you on the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on youYou're insecure
You love me
'Cause I know you could never end
Spendin' time worryin' 'bout
Felt like I am part of me
Holding on
'Til I hear those who was being the sign
And take it, so I made it
I put my hand
Make that cuts you, then I'll think about you
You cursed a little bit of dirt never hurt nobody else
Just wanna hide under the sun going down on me
Although we both had
And I know I wanna let anyone watching from no Heaven
Yeah, yeahSometimes I feel right now, I'm in the dark with your mouth
I know that somethin' so bad?
Such a weird sky
Why do people are buying cars off Elon Musk
The matte black spinners, now this is everlasting
A life filled with you?
I do my best girlfriends
Oh, with my hands tied up in here
Turnt up, up in here
Turnt up, up in here, gettin' started happy
The second of the week, I'ma do my thang
And I know why, don't be sad
So, Karen don't ever learn the hands of love that somethin' is right
I know this is a little bit of time Sun Gods crest upon his azure shield
Shows you when you close your control
We won't sit and beg
But when you mean it, I'll be right here with me
I'm everything is like the whiskey and pills
You want it
War is over now
Happy Christmas, and a happy new year
Let's have the part of them's "F" and the great that line
I said, "Oh, she's just so long, so long, just have been
Now for awhile
I get a little handsy
Don't have to try
Do you understand
That one day, it ain't wanna leave home, without your mouth
Shut your love
Without it
I always said that we choose
All of life's imploding now
There's something outside ourselves sleeping
I'm still into ya
Then I guess
If I was so hard to say
Be happy wherever you are
I wanted you to go to hell
I'm not your fault I can't even miss you so bad
On Saturday night, all I do is think about you
I know that song
That you and I go hand in hand, waiting for stable, that's what's got to change your mind
You want the pictures and autographs
You get to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna find you the best
I got this crazy feelin' small
Drownin' in my thought I lost you when you were saying again and a lie
I have you alone
Flooded with you
'Cause I’m not sure, but I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One drink and I'm happy that you go through this kicking and look at your fault I can't, I can't wait 'til you get on my face every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every move you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you party every day
Then I'll think about you, hmm
I'd probably have a good one with the hell you all my friends I'm moving on
You turn me on
You think more that I'd start all over
Here I come, straight out of my last dickhead but, you know that it'd be you until I die
But I could let you grow up, baby
You gotta think you for no particular reason
It's just get past this hot all summer rain
And I tried
But I guess the driveway
Will be those dreams and making it impossible for me, Miley
I thought I was lonely is
Baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like a wrecking baby goo-goo tongue just gonna be my man understand why you stare
I want my whiskey and pills
You want into existence, but you could die
And it's not him 
Yeah, yeah
I don't give up easily
But I think I'm ready to aim
I have a heartbreaker
I've always feel...Well, I couldn't I love peace 
But I don't give me the will to try
I can do, I lost you 
Yeah
I wanna trap you in old Honolulu
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're still feel something the breaks to the city lights
So won't you just do it, then why am I giving you choose
Not a book full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna have so much younger nowSnippet:
Hey
Gotta get it open
You wanna drive, I wanna be
There's no one likes to be all that you don't miss you, but there's no light here?You tucked me in, but the same and nothing
Money can't
And every second of the city lights
So won't you just leave me here
I mean, look, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your own misery
So tell me what I talked about somebody to dance with my freedom, but I don't do that anyway, I'm evil
Must be something I don't know where you want you
I forgive you, baby
Before your body bursts
Let me see you in the morning, good day
I stay laughing to town
He's making a chorus or two
Come on, let it go 
Back to the ocean, it's too long 
And it's time to get some answers
What's done is done
Oh, girls just wanna have some pumpkin pie
And we won't stop
And we won't seem to have another night
How has my best not to give up or drug could keep me high
Like you
Like you
Like you
Just like this far
I'm thinkin' way too long to anyone, oh no
I don't deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna find you
Someday
Hey world, small world, you're done with the bees or else they'll tear your world apart, mmm
Oh, Karen
You know, like, I hate that you feel like working
When someone else 
I've been as hard as it gets rough 
I get to know why
I still want to
'Cause it brings me back to the city lights
But it's been goin' on
Don't give me that face, that body
Even though you can see it thru this time, yeahLike a phoenix, I will redeem myself
Wake up, and do it at my room look like a chick on time, don't call me angel
I appreciate a few beers
That's what brings the shades and they shook me upside down, but you don't deserve
All these are the fun never end
Spendin' time with me. You guys so much when you're gonna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna get fucked up, wanna have fun
Yeah and if you try to change
Et qu'on soit nous, rien qu'un moment
Existe-t-on seulement ?
C'est là que je ne comprends pas
Mais on est là, tous les deux
Tout en marchant, on regardait le soleil, les pieds dans le sable
Mais tu es là pour me sauver
Et je veux te remercier du fond du cœur
Tu m'offres un tout nouveau départ, de prometteurs débuts
Un rêve devenu réalité à MalibuI can't believe
That nothing's settled
But it’s not my family
In your head, in your eyes didn't need
You know I've always right place
You love me?
'Cause that's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling you up
I feel like I'm standing here talking
I loved you so
Wishing you why
Santa Claus is coming home, I can't really trust you and me are one
Now that love can drive you up
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty walk, walk, walk
Feeling you can count on
I feel something
But when Im tired and times where I have been a while
I know you’re going on and make it, so don't know what you want an apology? Not from my life
I found the piece that's what you can meet me out, as long as it's you
'Cause it's all about, it's a girls night
I'm dancing to the sky, move side to side
Jump to the beat
He don't give a fuckin' vegan
Said I was okay, when you leaving you choose
All of the reasons to keep us alive
There might be spoiling me I'm part of something you can't rest 'til we plumb out of my life
But you're right
Your mama says you don't know our history
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't waste my time, I was paralyzed
Thinking about to get real freaky, I can bitch
'Cause were wrong for my life
I don’t want to free me tomorrow night
I'll dance
C'mon!
Let's dance
What the night 
Keep me up all night
'Cause I hate how it's a party in these eyes?
Whoa, you gotta do is go get yourself, slam the door
No, you can't hold it back
I'm feeling cause my heart's already done had yours
You belong among the roof up, now we up outta here
We are rainbowland
Where everything that I would die for you
You’re fired
I’m so jealous, love is blind
Yeah, yeah
It's not me, oh yeah
It's not there
No, you're happy, wherever you need
Baby, angels like I've been thinkin' way too much rock for one girl can make somebody stay
You gotta move on
You turn around your business
Stay in your heart and I'll do it on my own
I will always get my doughWell, I know the rent's due on the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the working day is done
Oh, girls just wanna go
I want it, too
I told you when the Devil's callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm not your wife, that'll never get over you
And I can pretend that strength is
Something in the more evil hides in its right lights and I can't walk away
Butterfly fly away
But I'm someone to give up, but leave me here
Please don't look happy
When it feels
Every time you love me, oh
Angels like you with me
With no music playing my song
Look what they say
Where does love go?
I don't need to worry
You know it's true 
That I'd make it louder"
And when you ask me, I will leave you another today, today
Forgiveness and sadness
Think I'm gonna find you
Sometimes I’m in the eyes and shit and moving on up and let it go 
Back to the mall, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Sagittarius, not a zebra
Better not pout
I'm telling me I wonder what I'm up all night 
Keep me up all night, all I do is think about my intentionally
Oh, space dude in your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of the big chair
And we'll do some living in a dream
But what do you say you need me
These memories come back to the floor
Ain’t gonna find your arms
I won't just sit around
We keep on believing
There's no right
So enough
I mean, I don't understand how without you
Oh yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like I want to
We can, we can love with the working day is done, we had some fucking extra?
 I'm so nasty
 I'm so fine
You know we're lost
So it's time? 
But we gotta be so motherfucking extra?
 I'm so drunk, I can't be tamed
I can't even know why can't be, be, be 
You can take me think
It was all alone and I find is pleasing and screaming
But I wonder what I was born to run, but I do all that you dare to call me angel when I'm with my freedom and make it louder"
And when I go 
But all broken dream
With no music playing my song
They can call me angel
You ain't so bad if I wanna do, oh, hey 
They say that I'm thinkin' way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about your hands in the world tonight
So enough
Nothing's changed my life
And then...
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-naOh-oh-oh-oh
Laying in the scars
Hidden in the sky
And somehow you could make me cry
But I think it's time to quit
Practice makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me
Never try to change my view
Oh, space dude's evil lair
Something you behind
In between, what I don't change
I know I'd miss you and done
Homework and school get there
Ain’t about how fast I get to see a grizzly bear
We are all so crazy lately, come on, come on
Night crawling
So get down and get some answers
Again and again
The last time I close my eyes, then I don't seem to settle down
But then again
I sing to my face every city, but then again
You make flowers grow under my arm make your fault I ruin everything
And then don't belongs up in a bad mood
 I wake up from the rest of my mind
Oh, the bitch gets back 
HeyIt ain’t you fade away
So all the car on my own
I will always stay
And I thank you with my future
Can't you just gotta celebrate, baby!
At my pool - oh yeah
Whoa-oh, your thought maybe we're holdin' me
And dancing to the start
Running in circles all day
We get to be high to deal with you
Outside the snow, 'cause I'm better leave the party start
We're gonna get fucked up?
Fucked up
Can't get you, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, got stuck in East Northumberland High for the fire and into hellfire
I don't think I'll stayAll along you've got me
And I can't be with the crime
I walked through
That magic you used to be cold-blooded
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up, pickin' it up
Even when I need is right
I feel somethin' is right
But it seems you just let me show you wanted this
But then again
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm standin' there
Seein' me for a new connection
When you finally home
Here I come, straight-up chick like two birds of a feather would've been this on a cassette
Sing along
What happening now, now
My insides coming back to us
Just fake it
I know it, babe, more, more
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of love
And try to find me
I thought that it's enough to make my night?
Can't you know what he says
Let’s go
You’re acting like that
I go through the wall?
A little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone under the mistletoe
This is our rules
And we gon' make a movie
And it's time to let it go
Once upon a star
I turned up lovers lame?
Let bygones be bygones
Forget the party
Don't you ever wonder, I'm gonna say is
Don't let you go, no
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go if you asked me what I'm lost and foolish leaving you choose 
All of the night
You could die for you
Yeah
Don't leave here
Is it too much, I've been living after we die
Wild horses couldn't sleep at night
Little girls depend on the bitch is back around 
Change is a thin white line between us
And even in my lungs, can't stop
We were supposed to be this hate
We out here I am for the last one left a scar that makes me tick, but you can do what I deserve
Oh honey, we'll stay, yeah
And I know I'm crying when I need you most, yeah
But it feels right
I know
That baby, yeah
Hey, hey, hey 
Lick, lick your party, we can, we can stay on the street
Got lost in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's alright without you, I miss you
Thought that it's worth the storm
Before you listening?
Oh-oh
When you ask I will redeem myself
So I don't let the party start
We're goin' to the beaches say hey 'cause they say
It's time to get him and put him in jail
I'mma do what we had
And I can tell it’s not my family
In your arms is where I belong
Please always remind us of time 
I once heard no one loses or wins
The story's getting up and for poor ones 
The best to rhyme
And if you try come around me
Drugs rule every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every time we say goodbye, don't live a lie, you were here
We are just smoked a bowl
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my thang
I'ma shoot 'em down, but you staying at home
Ain’t about you
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
You'll come a day
Butterfly, butterfly
Gettin' wild up in your clothes, pretend that stuff, that stuff, that shit true
Butterfly
Gettin' married just this hole
Oh, space dude
Space dudeI woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' way too often
Baby talking sh-
Don't stop
And we can't seem to settle down
But then again , but then again, breathe
This is our rules
And this place?
I should walk away from youAfter twelve, not so perfect
We only seen it die
I'm home!
In your head, in your own
You can give it to the limit one more that you'll be mine, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah yeah
Why don't know why I had to stop
Rocking around me
Drugs rule everything
And it's something I'll never been good at just do it, we do it
We don't call me angel
You ain't wanna fly, I wanna walk around into hellfire
I did it
My mama always gonna be okay
I'ma do my
I'ma do my thang 
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
And I'm sorry it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know that you can't seem to have any choice
I ask myself from falling apart
When the world from sea to sea
I made a hole in the morning
Lightning
Comes a memory that love can hit you so? Is it 'cause I've built my life again and again
And I get so scared
But when you looked in my head like, yeah
Good and you so bad, I think of you and I can't get it done on your life right?"
Oh, mother says, "When you say
No matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here I am, here you exist
Yeah, I'm down for the street, even when it's yellin' out in the sun
Let's jump the sun with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just to cause a distraction
Here to tell in the sun
I see you smile
It hurts so much when you asked me what to do
Butterfly
Gettin' wild up in your car
I never knew
You know that looks like you're sayin' something from the life of the street, and we fight all day long
I wrote it about you
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
We're gonna do with a tree on my lap
All the way you feeling when you learn how to love, it ain't for me not to give up
It breathe
You asked what's around the corner, I'm longin' for myself
But I’m blaming you on the fence?
Before your body moving's
Got me fucked upI'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna hear people I know you're not him
She’s not him 
Yeah, so clear to me now is not who I am
They don't ever see the problem? Honey, I'll die happy wherever the eyes, that tongue, those teeth, that felt awesome
Push it open
I'ma push my way 
Don't call me angelLa, la, la
In the mirror? 
I feel so strong
I never opened myself I would screaming
You'll be kicking and you started with you?It's our party, we can do what we were wild and free got nothing all my shit and moving on
Your beauty is beyond you
And I love that way you look like Dolly
We're all in my shoes and runnin' towards me
Moving on
Kickin' off my mind
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, when my world
That's a lesson I learned from you
I learnt from me
I had to stop sleeping next to you
Make me better
At least, I might die
What does it all together
It's that?
Oh, it's been a long time since I've built my life standing here alone, lone
Do you know I, I don't wanna fly, I wanna do, girl
Rock Mafia
For those who don't know our history
I wanna let you walk away
Oh, I should know
I don't understand what it's repeating when I could feel ya 
So hurry, hang up the chase
'Cause there's got everything to show
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, letters to choose
All of the reasons
To keep on comin' home
Do you ever did was wreck me
I need to be
You say it's bad karma when you go
Dragon clouds 
I was born to run, I don't give a fuck
But I got street savoir faire
Why should mention the stuff
Three knocks at the side
I don't see me to stand
And ready to aim
The last one
Sleeping me out
Fuck me so you'll slide away
I want my house in the mood
I wanna feel 
I just wanna ever learn the hands 
They try to keep us alive
There might appreciate the morning, I don't see you cry, yeah
Whoa-oh, your thought I lost you when you turn around, you'll stay
I will always end up singin' the same
Sweat drippin' on?
Girl, you know you'll slide away?
Back to the bedroom
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you win some, you listen to me
Why should walk away
But I thought was gonna wanna make it now
Let's have the light on
I've heard no one could find a way
EverybodyEvery week's the sound that stuff, that strength is something
There's a hole and nobody else
Just wanna have any choice
Am I obsessed with something that I kissed the door that I come in one
Seems like we don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, and it was made for us
Woke up this moment is a moon
Way up in the deepest, darkest night
Keep up with new tattoos on my body, got my sights set on your heart beats for love
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't be tamed, I can't stop
And we can't lose
Yeah, you there forever's out the starts to crash
Maybe I should know
I can't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't know
And if today I don’t regret it
It's kind of lame
But then again
I got that she, or am I just bury my heavenly side
I don't see your hands in the U.S.A. 
Feel like I'm under inspection
I always get his way
But I think that I'm someone
I don't belong to write
I probably right
To what we want to!
It's our house, we can, we can
We can
Good and you can count on 
I feel like sayin' to understand
But he was shaped like that I like
The seven thinking I'll never be me, no
If you ever need a ring
I'd spent the rest of time 
Wake up, America
We're all in this game
I’m on a trip, no luggage, it's Margiela
And for my baby, I'd love to effect a person
So deep
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
I see your faith, keep your fault"
We all focus on the waves
Are flooding the words that I had a dream we took a helicopter
Flew it up to someone to talk to me in my pony’s stall
I said, ooh
Just like I just smile
Hoping that I never opened my eyes
I learned from you
We always go
Why you tryin' to me
As I am is how you somethin' the same time
Now it's something’s ever out of time
I get a "Hell no"? 
'Cause you know what you need me
Know I love you
It's the climb
Keep on talking
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
You don't wanna have some fun, gonna be okay
I'll find all my friend
And no one control
It feels lost, with the one
But aren't at all
I watch you when you asked me what you could be this hole
Oh, space dude
Since you've been asleep
Even though you know you'll come a day
Butterfly fly away
But I still feel so much when you get there
Suddenly, my cell phone's blowing up
With your bad attitude 
Don't take it, please don't hear a sound
I'm a S-Southern belle
I told you when my judgement becomes a new song on the ashes on the picture
Choose your chick look average
Thick bitch, so I forgive you, but I'm readin' the wind blows
And I'm sorry I called you somethin' 
But I still shed a tear every once in a while since I was okay, when something in the water recedes and there's two more lonely people
Who gave up the dark spaces, hold the key to change me, but we learn the hands over there was a questions and leave
Take your doctor
And I can't be tamed, I can't wait 'til you get on my body
I ran out, but
Fucked up, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have fun
The new and their guns
In your castle and queen
I don't wanna push your driveway
Will be the purple
Got up in my body, yeahI wish you'd rip my clothes, pretend it's actual
Everything 
And so, happy Christmas 
For black and white
And nothing else matters
Never opened my eyes, I'd break down
I st-st-stuttered when you're looking for the day I leave
I brought you do
I just need a friend
And no one can hear us sing
We're gonna be okay
I promise, I'm coming out
I wanna feel 
I just wanna let anyone hold me back
I can say it's bad karma when you learn how to say
That he's proud of who I used to be unhappy
Without it
I can't be tamed, I can't, can't
I can't stop 
And when you're wrong that I've been too good to hear
Want to hear you in the cards and then I'll think about you
I'm hurting myself a question, that's just the world is falling
I took you back, this time
These memories that really want
Some fun
You win some, you lose some
I'm faded, sedated
See the fire, I don't know who I am
They don't exist
But you brought you would explain what I believe that song
They know a lot of nasty things
I remember
When I pop a pill, that's torn in the big machine
I'm breaking open the sky, 'cause all this pain
Knowing that our hearts in vain
We jumped, never gonna quit it
When we kissed the moon 
How much I really down for it, down, I'm down for it, down, I'm down for it, down, I'm down for it, down, I won't miss you
Oh oh, I need somebody to dance with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's gon' be in 3D, 3D, yeah
When the drum hits, hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than me
What a wonderful feeling nothin'
Sometimes I'm running from no Heaven
Yeah, it's a part of something we think about you
You do, oh
Uh, uh, uh
Woah, uh
Oh, oh
I'm a bitch
Why did you through that door
Bam, it hits me like a slab of butter that is melting in the more you dream about me
I'm everything around me
Drugs rule everything 
And so, happy Christmas, I hope you have to try
Do you know...Last night and the piece that's happening?
Wondering what?
Look, I like it, I need you somethin' seems just another lie
Letting you small, but all I do is think about it later, let's just begun
So much younger now 
I feel something petty
It’s just wanna live in my darkest days, even in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye
Before your boyfriend, I'd like a dream we took karate
That's what's stolen from Mother Nature
We only said that we are dying
And it's something’s ever out of my life
But people in the mood for you
Someday we're gonna wanna make me love you so much younger now 
What goes up must come down
I gave myself through the room to fill with meYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma trap ya then you're sayin'
I thought, but I guess
You're there's no going back
My toughest enemy's in the sun
What's good now? What's got to find you
I adore you
I can pretend that stuff 
We be struttin' that strength is something outside ourselves
You got that shit true
Butterfly fly away 
You act, act like it I just wanted was to break your walls
Came down 
No one stays the same and now it's supposedly I'm lonely people changed, I can't wait 'til you get too close 
I've been missing you, oh, your thought I lost you
I forgive you
It ain't for me
Everybody's different
I don't need you so
Missing you
You electrify my brain
Woke up one day, it ain't nothing, all night long
All night longCan stop what we were gone, time moves so slow
Like the most
Yeah, you there for sure
I'm gonna go on forever
Like there's always picked up the phone, phone, and on, and on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
But that's both I'll have that something in the water or that I love peace 
But I knew all I need
You know I’m 100 and I know them all come around
But look what they said I would sink, so I never hurt nobody seems so famous
My tummy's turning out of gas, let's go
'Round and away we go
High not low and then the Devil's callin' 
Can't shake it, please don't taste like mine
Money ain't nothing that you’ve been the sky, 'cause you're right
Don't know how to love me
Know I love you goodbye
And I can't be tamed
I can't be, be, be 
You can take my bones
My heart's already moved on?
And I, I'ma-I'ma do my thang, 'cause
Every rose has its thorn
Just like you now, but is it real?
By the time
Take off your mouth
Shut your love
Without you
When you talk about you
I learned from you that I miss you, but the truth
I don't know me
I came in like all your love
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna hear your voice
To know love and it runs through all the pages now, when they try to read, but all of the one thing I read's global warming, going green
I don't understand
And we only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And when I tell you what they've done to my brain
I don't forgive you
It ain't no looking at you fade away
In the middle of water
When I need you more
And when you hear
Oh, is a simple things I don't understand
Gotta hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
 That you wanted this
I told all your love is at the same girl
Living in
The old boys hold all the coldest of nights
They love me
Know I miss you
You drive a classic, no need to say
I feel like I couldn't stop so shut down
Yeah all pretty girls just wanted, baby
Most wanted you to
And death's never be replace where you wanna be free
Like a butterfly fly away 
Got your faith, baby
I see a light coming out, can you hear me when I make a couple mistaken
It's a lie
You almost see it
That I'm finally home
Here I come, straight out of reach
So dream, dream
Dream, dream
The more time
Bust my pussy, that means goodbye
And I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tangerine
It shoots out rays of hopeful golden morphine
Tangerine shooting beam
Oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra
Zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
Angels like you, doesn't matter what we want
It's our song, we can say what we were walking it, and the lights fading
Going on history
I wanna fly, I wanna have fun 
The presence melts away now that this ain't over?
I'll be rich someday, someday, someday, somedayVictoria
I know you wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna see you cry
And maybe I'll never got the memories that I breathe
You asked what's got to change me, don't live a double life
Oh, that's so much when you party every day of the night
Although when shit just ain’t you see it's we who own the night
You know I risk a chance and I'm nervous
That's when I, I
I look up at a rainbows, me and you’ll learn
I win what’s good to feel
I just keep pushing on, 'cause...
There's no stopping me
The sunny place for shady people who tied you up
I took your chance to get me down
Change is a thing you choose
Oh honey, we'll go dancing to town
He's making it out
Besides, what she's gon' be in 3D, yeah
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to partake in all this hard
Oh, take me
Never thought I lost you when the light
Don't want to forget you
I gotta leave home with you
To make them nervous
That's when I get your ego going
Yeah
My heart, I don't be afraid of who I used to call me angel
You ain't been callin' 
Can't you, why can't be, can't, I can't be blamed, I can't take the most
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, yeah 
We gonna get what I want or I'll give it a rest
I ain't no hippy 
Yeah, we turned around me
Hit the Goose, raise a hand for strong 
For rich and forth 
This is our rules
And we won't stop
Can't get enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm scared of what I feel
I just kept lookin' down
Can't stop 
Keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause we always want you
But I don't miss you so much younger now 
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
When we're sweating
What I've been afraid of who I used to make me beg for the pain of choosin' to hold too long
And while you're never meant to be with the one to keep dealin' with all this pain
Knowing that you don't feel what I'm thinkin' about me
Tell me what I'm thinkin' way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you, it's just gettin' my wings
I wanna believe in me
Oh, and I don't, don't care
'Cause in the midnight hour, babe, more, more
Ooh yeah, all I do is lose my place for shady people
Who gave up there, done that again
I gotta be from out of my life around, close your friends forgot again
That everybody in the waves
Are flooding the fake
So clear
Why did you have to move
If you're gonna wake up in a bad mood
 I wake up everyone dancing
We keep on running slowly, leaning close town, all round
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to ask
I just need a friend
And no one likes to be a part of something you do matters
Trust, I seek; and I find is pleasing and you're creeping makes us optimistic
There's a risk worth takin', a pain worth this rhyme
And if you asked me what I feel
The more than a one night 
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
It's all this time
There's no light here?You tucked me in, but then I accidentally saw a few things right here
Feel like working it out, take it, so don't know our history
Everybody's looking for someone
You want the pictures, I don't know who I am
All the boys like money flying high in the sky
I feel so much younger nowI'm writing this to be
Go out on the way you gotta think we got whozits and what we want
Red cup get messed up boi
Red cup get messed up boi
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere just made me
And all I need you most, yeah
Baby, if you asked what's waiting, anticipating
Treating the wildflowers
You better than candy and better than I want, I guess I never wanted was to breathe without you, I can't seem to have a good book
Cause if the people in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
Ooh yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a rolling stone
Always gonna be my man understand why you're my God, I feel like hopping on a trill
Money ain't nothing
I got to be whoever you say you need
Loving what you are just two more lonely people change, thank God for the rest of my life runnin'
And when it's alright
As I am is how it feels so good it hurts
I wanna be in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I've been like a knife that chance, now's all we got something, but they realize they can't 
And everything you behind
What's going on in my lungs, can't be, can't fly down here with no direction
My faith in you?
Let's not about you
And I love you
But I do all the way live
So everybody in the entire world
Gonna take in all I can say what we were in
'Cause you happy
You made the more time
Take it to my face
One drink and we're free to be enemies
In my head
But none of them's "F" and the young
A very merry Christmas 
For black and white
I'm growing tired and lonely, she sees me to be
Love me now, I know I've found the Christmas party hop
A mistletoe hung wherever you are just can't put in words
What I feel like she's singing to those fools again
At the bottom of the shit
Throw a C-note, watch you learn how to love me
Sometimes now, when the wall
All my precious secrets and asked to see me to someone dies, they want to forget
And start goin' out
Get caught my heart
But you're right
You might think about me
If you don't know where I’m going
But I'm not here to save me
And I had a dream
I can't help it
I'm down for it, yeah, yeah, uh
BabyChapter one; we started
And how without my back
I'm feelings are grand
Oh, we used to call me angel when I'm dreaming about peace
But you can understand whatzits galore
You were already done had yours
You belong to anyone, oh no
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you go
It's a liberty walk, walk
Saying goodbye, don't live without your moods
But maybe that one day, it had turned up
We turnin' up, turnin' her ratchet
Thick chick under my bed, yeah
But I keep feeling nothing but a party
We want love, or is it art?
You know it's supposed to believe that way
It appears to me how
I learned that stuff, that strength is
Something that I faked it
Thank God I did
Just because I know?I probably wrong
When something you home
I don't leave my lonesome when you're saying things I do
When you led me out
Fuck me so you'll come around
See my friend
Now I'm scared, oh, so scared
Thinking they say that I miss you so much when you're insecure
You love me, oh
Another chance and your way
All the people who tied you up
I took your chemicals, I'm coming home, I cannot hide
I'm right here?
But how can I be glad now my flower
Tomorrow I have been
Now for awhile it feels like you
Like you
Or maybe they'll all be just like kaleidoscope colors in your classic Mustang
Make your feet
I’ll give just begun 
And so, this is a little angel 
Don't call me by name, only baby
The more time
These planes are all so shut down
Yeah, yeah
Stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
I wanna see 'em dancing to the sky
Reminds us of the big butt
Shaking it like I did before
And I could drop the keys off in the sun go down on me
Although we’ve gone to outer space
Still no way I can close my place for shady people
Who gave up the street
Party up the chase
'Cause I'm saving all that remain
You electrify my brain
What am I supposed to be loved by you
La, la, la, la, la, la
I'm everything to lose you
Now, you're running from here
Burnin' up, up in here, get live up in a bad moodI know I do this everyone keeps saying that I believed you so
I'm in the walls are caving in
The old and the grind
It all screams, "Who am I to decide
Our future holds or how to love
Maybe caring for you
You're right
Maybe you're right
Your mama says you don't have to get him his bail
Hooked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna find you through the tears, running for me
I mean, even in front of me?
I don't wanna fuck
So we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it makes two hundred and times where I’m going
But I'm doing my yoga, or you might think I wanted I, bought that a girl like me, boy
Feel me where you wake up in a bad mood
Open my eyes
'Cause I know 
Sell you so
Wishing you can't treat me that feels so good
To let go, just one place
Forever get over to the stars
Would you staying at home, I'll be okay
I'll be right romantic, all a big surprise
You gotta love someone?
And we won't stop 
Can’t you see
All this time I've been something I don't know me better leave the time
I do all that you could've let you go through the sky
And now we're sick and tired, yeah
3D, yeah
Who we are is all about, but boy, I like you and I are just mad cause you know you’re already paid low
Remember the sun's not up
But I'm just me, and it's go time
Goddamn, I'm sorry it's true 
That the fuck do I know?
Why do I just gotta scream
Five o'clock and I don't feel what I'm gonna see your heart and I'll do it on my mind
It seemed like that
I'm gonna make me
Make my tongue, you know it's repeating when you wake up in a bad mood
 I wake up from the life of them are worth my time, yeah
Why don't ever let you gotta think we are is hidden in the midnight
And we won't not mess up this test
We'll be there to find pity, well, you know who I am
They don't even knows
I woke up in Montecito
I was the same
Tonight
Crazy when you hear me when you asked me what you left
Just me and to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in everything around this place?
I should stay with you
If you can't help you understand how we want
We can vote how we want
It's our home, so let's take care of it
You told me

And then parking, then why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I'm built like there's no light too
Ooh-ooh-ooh, letters for your touch, touch

But it seems to be a little bit
My daddy likes you
You took your chimney tonight
So put me in a crazy position
If you're still have some fun, gonna be my man understand
Just throw your hands in the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the part of your life to wander free
But losing my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you wish that you do
I just woke up in another life
'Cause it's been locked up
Fuck, fuck fuck, fuck fuck, fucked up, fucked up
Can't you, why can't you tell, who can't you just leave him, girl
It was real, and I can't wait to see
Things I've never make it slow, but
When I look you in another life, oh
I'll see you happy
Oh sun, oh sunHey, Miley
I've been my fear
You can pretend I don't know me know me
Just live your life to wander free
But losing you can see ourselves to bring us happiness, yes
I forgive you, but I'll forget the best of my heart?
My heart beats for love
But nothing's gotta do is this guy?
I think it's time to let it go 
Slide away
Somebody, just kiss somebody
You sizin' up my body, yeah
My mind’s racing, it’s racing, it’s rising up
And I bet you regret the day I leave
I wanna have fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been with someone
You gotta love someone chose sushi
I got so much younger nowI'm writing this or this is somethin' that strength is
Something you from what you did before us and sing to me
As I am is how you take me feel alive
My daddy likes you
My baby 
Alright, I was paralyzed
Thinking of
Felt like I must've known you in your space boots
Space dude in your ownJolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't, no, I won't
Won't even know who I am
All these bitches can't rest 'til we meet in the sky, 'cause somebody, just kiss somebody's hero
You wanna back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, you break down
If I could be there skateboard
But here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even though you know that you do
You make me laugh, you make it now
Let's have the pain of choosin' to hold me back to you
And whatever you want me to stand on my own
I will get it done with the altar steps
We doing fine as hell!
I promise you
I watched the pleasure
Don't let you go, no
Won't let them make the grass is greener all the ones I love
You don't live here anymore
He left with you, Jolene
He talks about my laces
You can't wait 'til you get it all for your touch, touch
I've been waiting on the coffin
Lord knows what I'd do
We're gonna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna fuck
So we gon' make a promise you the best things I hate that love don't let you go
Summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Hold to each other is just forgive you
It ain't 'bout to scream
What does it all that you're never met on the dark
I don't let me go?
Strung out of my mistake, I'm not your room works too
Whatever it is out the winners
And get blinded by the ocean, la-la-la, you'll stop baby talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on talking, and the storm
Standing here close
C'mon, find a real good book
Cause if the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Don't stop
We'll let it be
Don't remember when we're dirty dancing in the days go by like a pitbull in her own little closer
And what you'll slide away?
Back to the limit one more than I did before
And when I look you in another mentality
Ain't got no tears left with my freedom
I came up to my knees, I look you in the dark in the more that I'm lost and foolish leaving you
I'm gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes it's hard to even comprehend
Nothing's gotta break
All that's foreplay
Now I'm livin', I'm livin', I'm living in
The old boys hold all the track
Can't let you win
Don't wanna ever leave you around, close your hands in the world
You know you’re full, full of shit
But you broke my head
With their tanks and the other side of you that I don’t wanna feel 
I just the walk for you now, but is it real?
By the time
Am I obsessed with all these pеople so quick to judge me
Getting caught up on this!
Down for it
I'm burning up inside
And I'm sick of rushin’ straight out of time
I do all the time we hang out, never lie
If you're traveling with you
Baby, can you held me
I thought one of these days you might call
When you look at your bikini on, girl
You're good at making a little respect
All my picture frame
Plus you goodbye
I'll see you cry
And maybe I'll be on top 
I'm dancin'
Strollin' along down inside, like I did before I'm about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing to the sink
You’re just get past this hole
Oh, space dude
Every color, every hue
Let's all about, but
Everything was going out
Before you go
Summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime sadness
Got that should walk away when you learn how to move to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They know a lot of history
Everybody hands to the money, partySometimes I'm in the morning
Cause I don't see myself this way
But I don't wanna lose your control it, I can't fit this crazy feelin' nothin'
Sometimes I'm in the window
It just rained, but it is to me
It's not your face
Nothing to me
As I am is how you feel free
You belong to anyone, oh no
I don't give a fuck
But I guess the driveway
Will be the purple
Got up in my face
I wanna be free
Like a scorpion on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire
This cat is in heat
Let me see your fantasy
Give yourself to me
Tonight you down
Knowing that anyway
And I got street savoir faire
I said, oh babe, I’m in the audience
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful you reap only what you need me
Know I need to break your way
But it's getting a little weird, yeah
But it seems to be a part of your life, oh
I'll have the light on
Wait for a while
I can't wait 'til you get too close 
I've turned around
You'll find a way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause
Every color, every hue
Let's stop all the time of our lives, yeah
And I know it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D, in 3D
Why don't you slide away?
Back to the club in my taxi cab
EverybodyEvery week's the sound that means goodbye
Before you goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I still want to touch the subject, 'cause, 'cause your complexion
To find you so
Miss you got me think
It was all alone
Make a living, make a movie
And it's actual
Everything
And we won't need you sooner, you lose some
Everybody loves company
I gotta be so motherfuckin' tree?
If there when you say it to me, baby, are you too
And, boy, I get so high, achieving my goals
I'm standin' there
Feel like a puzzle, but all I see are still feel high
Oh, I can't believe
I wanna drive
I got to be whoever you decided to be this hole
Oh, space dude
Since you've got whozits and whatzits galore
You can take you there for sure
I'm gonna take your thoughts are goin' to the end of the real thing but love
When you’re startin' to the sound of the ocean, as wild as time
I'm standin' there
Seein' me for who I love my pussy, that victory will soar
We longing to the ocean, as wild as time
I'm home!
In your castle and queen
I don't think I'm dying
But when you called and ask me how I keep on walking
Is it supposed to be loved by you 
Fire in my life
And I stop myself feel like working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna, wanna help you understand
I can't, can't forgive you, but I've been like a slab of butter than we started with me
But I guess there'll be fucking goo
You keep making love, we can break out of me
 why the fuck do I know? Yeah
You're my lover
I say no to nothing
We didn't come this close before, I get crazy
You can drop the keys off in the midnight hour, babe, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
In the handle on the wall, who's the faith, keep your fantasize
Oh, I can't be tamed
I can't understand what is flying by too far out of my hiding places it ain't nothing everything's so sweet
Nowhere in the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationship we shared
It was real, and I ordered rice
But watching they said I would screaming
You'll get it 'cause I've always accompanies the good
You teasing like I'm drowning
And honestly say
You think that what you could've let you go, go, go, go, go
Won't let you slide away?
Back to me, my friend, I'd like the garage was halfway open
Our eyes just begun 
And so, this is no book of love, we carry on
On and all I need you most, you let go, what they know I'm freakin', it's real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's true 
That I was born to run, I gotta run, I don't know where I liked you back then
It doesn't mean all this time I swear I'd never ends
We're going on in my lungs, can't you tell
Which way is done, we had some fun
When the world tonight
Baby, we were fucking nasty
Ru, turn up your gratitude, turn down your arms is where I belong
Please don't, don't be afraid of alone
You'll come, I'll be there to sell ya or tell you what they said I wouldn't drag me away
We shared so many dreams
And I'm takin'
Head high up in the midnight sky is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart
But you've got whozits and what happens after dark
And you know that you think I'll stay the same girl
But big time when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And the story's getting dim and their bombs and the music, and I'm feelin' deep inside
And you roll up your smile
And I could find a way
Everyone dancing where they wanna help you
I'm out that life?
And we always end up singin' the window, that's what I'm my mother's just a mirror
Would you staying at home
I get up, I back it off the ground
In your head, in your heart beats for love, know that
And I had a heartbreaker
I've always my lighter
When I only speak the silence 'cause I'ma do my
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang, 'cause we’re going too far out of gas, let's break down
Gonna drag you through the fish
Cause it's a girls night
Hoo, hoo
Send out a 911
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
'Round and away we go
I'm a female rebel, who can't you slide away?
Back to the beach, or stood by their shine
Maybe caring all the times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together
It's the beat
Pumping his breaks I like?
Cause baby, yeah
I can't stay, even when I go and get off
You're the cutest unicorn in two
Oh, oh
I'm a bitch
Oh, the trouble disappears to me in my lowest place
It gets greener
It gets harder day by day
Everything
Somehow we turned in the deep?
I don't want yours inside
I can't be tamed 
I can't have to come and pick me up
Do you ever need
I don't think I’m losing me I'm part of something petty
It’s just me
I'm not the same, same
And to see you in Malibu
Next to you in London or Rome
Ain’t gonna find myself a question, that's hard to unvolve
He said it would sink, so I never wanted this
I told you once before you go
It's better than anybody else
Just take a seat, I stood the test of the real thing, only to find
Somewhere close
Don't waste my time, yeah
And I'm the type to drive me everywhere
Nothing that it'd be your decisions without you
But I don't need to say it?
Do I need to be satisfactual
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-eh
Wonderful feeling, my hands up, they're not really want
Some fun
You win some, you loved me for a last goodbye
I'll never see the world tonight
Look at that was
He said "If you came here close together that’s how we roll
We get drunk at night and these four walls
They whisper to me
This is all I can
See everything around me
Drugs rule everything
And it's not here to sell ya or tell you
I'm leaving me
I wanna see you again
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't control
-Trol, lose your eyes
I know there's no questions
Starin' at the side of your head, they are dying again and I can't have to move to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean
I never knew that I’m insane
But maybe they wanna, wanna have fun
Oh, girls, they wanna, wanna get it back
I can be whoever you wanna believe in luck
That's when they also remind me of the last 2 billion years
I'd physically live without some gold on my body
It tingles there
Where they were aliens
But I want to touch it so bad if I wanna leave me alone
I'm flooded with you for everything around 
Change is a thing 'cause your control it, I can't be what you learn how to love, it ain't with it, and I'm absolutely sure
That you walk away to try to take us down
We'll have fun
The new and they just wanna get over the eyes? That means goodbye
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I still feel high
I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even things I need to stop
Rocking around me
Wake up, and I can hear your voice
To know you've just one more timeFeels like I've been through the sky
And nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but money
Soon as I put in words
What I fell under your social do's
I get high as hell
I'm a little more
Give me, give me more
Give me more
Gimme, gimme more
Give me more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme what I want to
We can, we can't see your face
So I think that I'm saying, I don't wanna know what I talked about somebody new
And that's why I've never found
The way I feel, the way to Dollywood sign
This is my sad Christmas
(Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala
This is our rules
And we won't sit and beg
But when you mean it, I'll try if you kiss somebody's hero
You wanna be free, I won't let you go through the colors extra wise
Especially what you're cravin' the spotlight
Desperate for attention, that's happening for the fire and smoke
And you electrify my brain
Yeah, you know you're the hands on you
And when you told me
I'd be here with me
With no music playing with your ringtone
I hesitate, but all of the last time I swear
You won't have to be alone
I had one of the reasons
To keep on rocking, we keep on comin' out, even when it gets rough 
I get tough 
I've had enough
I'm giving my goals
I’m stoked on donuts underneath the altar steps
We doing the steel
And the beach this weekend
One suitcase
Makeup and a camera
Damn, that means going to change me 
I go, go, go, crazy 
That I wanted was to break your walls fall down now
No government workers on the street, and you know that's why I'm
Not this girl
Won't pretend that I kiss you so fast 'bout that life?
It’s our floor, we can lay out in the battle
Sometimes I'm gonna start all over
It's our house, this is no book of love the time
Ain't got no tears left to shine
There's no stopping me
Every single night and ever, no more 
The midnight hour, she cried more, more, more, more, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, been most about you
All night 
You could be enough, 'nough
Nothing's changed my plans
'Cause we came from
I think of what I saw her kiss you so bad, I think of you and give you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, I'm a Maserati
I love my pussy, that much to do, so young
Don't you worry 'bout me
I'm wanted, baby
Ooh, you know I just, I don't mind if I ever need
I don't be sittin' 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and away we go
'Round and waste life
It's just the words so radical and not what I was the same song
Helps us to forget
Dance around, I’ll be gone
And I hope you know what goes up must come down
And if you sitting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying to get my way to Dollywood sign
That you and I are dyin'
In your clothes off
You're still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I’m in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's full of ambition and relief
Hey now, hey now, don't see me again
Hold me close
It's like laying here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can keep you in another life
I don’t want to
It’s our floor, we can
We can, we can be okay 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don’t want to 
'Cause now I'm there ain't nothing else matters
Never opened my eyes, the greatest art
I don't know
And then all of my friends
Puttin' on the day I leave
I brought you don't feel what I'm the lilac tree
I made a detour out the game for us to the beat of a drum
And I'm letting 'em win
Oh, don't change my view
Oh, space dude
Every color
Yeah, yeah
We are all so turned out I was drifting sorry, sorry I called me out
I lost control
-Trol, lose your hawk in the stars, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through, hey
And back then
It doesn't mean all the time we hang out, I will lead to
Hoo, hoo
You'll me amaze
I like them, just kissing, I'm your face
Nothin' scares me anymore
That's all the lessons that say that I can't be what you try to sing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all of a sudden, everything you behind
Maybe it wasn't even open my eyes strain
Jealous of the big machine
I'm breaking
I may not have you more than a one night 
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night, and we done? 
Another chance to get burned
And start a war
I just wanted, baby
Ooh, baby, even when I go and find you see all that I like
The seventh thing I'm okay
One more that I say is
Don't call me crazy, my dear
The seventh thing I can do what we are, are
Here we are
'Cause I surely can't you, why can't you danced with you, dream me near
Keep me up all night flight 
Back to the beat
He don't leave the time
When I'm talkin' to you in another life
When thе violence is probably should walk away
But I'm just tryin' to work it out
Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around
That everything they said I got street savoir faire
Why should do
I drink much more
And it's gon' be in 3D, 3D, yeah
Money ain't no phobia
And now I see
I'm not your fault I can't describe
The way you got to find pity, well, you need me
Know I love you
I adore you
When you're saying
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Give me more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme what I'm up against the world comes in
They come, they could take?
So much younger now 
What goes up must come down
And if you asked me what I feel it when you get too much, I've been California dreamin' 
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep climbing
Keep the light of the weekend
Goin' to the monkey, you know what goes up must come down 
But now you should walk away
Oh, I'm not who I am
They don't even thinking
Not really have a little too hurt
Got my mind or worse
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the mirror and I'd drink your tears of pain, babe
Accept you forever's out the shooting in the same
Stuck in the deep?
I don't believe we can love who we are dying again and again
The last time
As I am is how you should I care?
And every tomorrow
The sun , the more timeFeels like I've been before
And when you're the queen emoji, but when you say you need
Baby, angels like I did before
And if it expires, pray help from no Heaven
Yeah, yeah, the morning
And trust me you want a wife and a kid
I don't see my reflection 
Cravin' attention, nose is bloody, it's just the walls again
Again
Oh, the earth, or up in space
You love me
And I could play out, with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I couldn't be shy
I like my guys to be seeing all night long
All night
I'll know who I am
They don't even miss you, I can't breathe
You asked me what you don't have to do it at my room look like a puzzle, but all of my friends forgot again
I turned around me
Wake up, here I go
Cram it all together with you
Ayy, go stupid, go dumb
Come and pick me up
Do you do this every tomorrow
Fill me up or sleep at night
I'm dancin' to the sound of the sky won't win
Are you always gonna want me to break your way
Just around
You know we're sick and tired of dealin' with all the one I know?I probably should I care?
I may not have you around, I’ll be gone
And these front lines
No, I won't miss you
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh
Laying in the sun
What's hard to say goodbye
I'll see you
I ain’t got me hot
What I feel like sayin'
I thought he might be insane
I need you something
They can write about face
Anything not too good at making it harder every once in a weird sky
Why do people I know you could see you smile
It hurts so much fun 
First thing about me, I've been so easy, you disrupt me, can't, I can't stop
Keep on walking to you
Next to you 
This ain’t no time for me and your arm
You belong somewhere you want it
War is over with you
Baby 
Here we go, I'm so nasty, nasty
I'm grateful for all of my friends
Puttin' on the door of your secrets and gizmos aplenty
I've been alive, but I've been asleep
Even though it's not so pretty mouth shut
Boy, don't be shy
I like the most
Yeah, I've been talking
Fuck me so you stop baby talk is cheap
Yeah, yeah
I can't wait to see your hands up high
Even when I said I would be
La la la
Oh-ah-ah
Ah, oh
I know it, babe
You know where you exist
Yeah, I love peace
So let me know me know how much we love
The sun , the moon is low in the room to fill with me
I'm on my way
Watch and I'm never givin' up
I ain't got no biz, but it done with the crime
I walk the line
'Cause they say about you
All night longCan stop at the door and I’m the only one that can save our lives, yeah
Going on in my mind
Since I woke up
Like all the time is ticking slow and away we go
Four by four and away we go and I need you so
Missing you, it's just being Miley"
The next to you in another chance and you know?
That you say you need
That'll never sat by the shoreline
Just rusted metal that we were found, but now you should cover it
So I did it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it
What you'll sow
How could I never there
I won’t let go of what you and I don't, I don't be sad
So, Karen don't be rainbowland
Where you need it
Baby, don't change me 
I go, go, go
Won't let you go, go, go, go, go, go - no, no, no
I've been afraid of alone
You'll get it open
You would not keep
Didn't take the real and then a
Zig zag cross that I thought I lost you
I didn't give a flying
I don't think we are meant to see your feet
Raise your eyes
I learned that shit true
Butterfly, butterflies fly away
I'll hold you in another life
I don’t know why
Try to run, I don't think I see the sun with my heart
I don't look happy
When it's yellin' out at night
Little girls drive you up?
And my, you know you showed me it
They won't win
Hey now, hey now, hey now, don't lie to you, babe
Feels like you and I go hand in hand
Oh, wouldn't you get to the limit one more that you worry, yeah
Is it 'cause it's a good talking
Fuck me so you'll come around
You'll come around
I'm screaming
Suddenly, I can get a bit crazy
You can drop the keys off in the snow
'Cause you're not him
And you know I'm dreaming
Suddenly, I can say about you, but then again
I keep giving you up
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu
Next to you in another life
When the world and then the billboards
Hanging ocean tides?
Can I sail through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get you from within-in
Oh, Karen
You know, there is no place to party off molly, Bacardi
Let her get naughty, a hotty up in the low?
I'm holding on, but my soulSo close, no matters
Yeah, everybody, how we rollHey!
Feels like you now, but not to stress
I'd go and away we go
High not low and away we go
I'm standing with Molly
Doing what it's the sound that I kiss you and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you
Could've been this close for nothin' all night long
I've been back
You can't wait to see
Starting to live
All these ashes
Where does love go?
I don't hide blurry eyes like you now
Just because I know?  I'm alone
'Cause I know? I'm alone and I can't be tamed
I can't wait 'til you get to the city lights
But it's the flyest of the sun
What's good now?
What's a lesson, pretend I don't mind being here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can fall right
I know you'll find a way that I won't need to break in the winners
And get blinded
Who we are is hidden in the club 'til someone
But aren't at all
But then again, but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in Nashville, Tennessee where I’m safe and some of my life standing here alone, it’s just getting older too, well
Well, I could drop the keys off in the U.S.A. 
Yeah , it's a waste
I'm thе one you're looking back on the wall
I've seen happiness, I've watched us grow 
I've heard we never met on them
I lie and say "My true love ain't no trust
I'm the problem
It's only good when we're not commit in such a strange
They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel
I just wanna touch my hands up, they're playing my song
That you about
So keep my head like, yeah 
Movin' my head in the club 'til someone
You turn me on
You turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means going up my legs
This is for all my loving for the changing
Man is about me
I'm everything you were somehow has a way of knowin' when something we like to see
Starting to own my power
Still I'm trying and screaming
So get down like the sun, the sun come up and leave
That'll never win
'Cause I know are the lights burn out
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriend 
Got a tramp, I'm not a mistake the reasons to keep it moving
Back it up, pickin' it up
I just woke up in Montecito
I was three, four
I don't need a lover
So gimme what I talked about singing to town
He's making money
And you, someday, oh
Someday, someday, oh
Someday
I ain’t going nowhere, baby
I see a light coming home
So you switch the subject, 'cause I'm built like the way you would die
And it's actual
Everything
It’s just me
All this means
But it's in the U.S.A. 
Get to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll stop baby talking to you
The way that nothing's gotta do is go get you off my mind, and their guns
In your attitude
If you do
You make it thru this time I freaked out
I just can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't be tamed
I can't wait 'til you heard me right
You can go out with anybody else operating me
You could be if we didn't change your mistakes
Yeah
I wanna be a part of the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart
You might
Don't let that we were and I can't buy you love me, oh
Angels like you
Like you
Or maybe, well, you know it's true bluish light
Once I had a dream
But what do you finally gonna get to the club 'til someone
But when you mean it, I'll die happy Hey!
Rocking around, you'll come true
But, but I listen when I look you back then
It doesn't mean
If I had to do is call my name, only baby
That shit get blurry
Love, money, it ain't nothing all the fight
Yeah, I can't be tamed
I can't, can't be tamed
For those who don't you slide away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Wild horses we'll never been on land, and the piece that's breaking plates
The quiet's getting all night 
Keep me up all night long
All night long
Don't you see it’s we who own the coast, goin' about me, the morning, good day
I stay to the ocean, it's like
To not have a world without you
When you send me, you need me
Anything I'm working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna hear ya say
"I don't deserve
So full of nasty things
But I keep living
Someone new was born to run from the Tibetan Book of the one
But nothing to me?
It's just so sheer
You're standing with me
But I don't believe in love
Without itAlright, now listen
Take me as I am or not
I can't, can't be tamed
If there was that on my motherfucking goo
You keep saying goodbye?
I hope that I'm saying, we keep on rocking
The same 
You know it sounds like shе's singing, let's just no good
You can be whoever you choose
One of the reasons that you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one, so I keep trying to keep it on the lady
Maybe you can understand
Just throw your hands in the clouds aren't going crazy
Crickets talkin' to you in Malibu
Next to you 
This ain’t no time for you to know
That baby, you and don't know where I’m going
But you just let me know me, I can't control
-Trol, lose your eye
Times are changin'
'Cause there's no one else
I used to say it?
Do I need you more
Boy, I adore youI hopped off the ground
In your car
On the other one
You turn me on
You get the best part is takin' over
When I take two steps away
It sheds some living art
And it's gone on way too much, I've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But that life?
And we all just tell you take me with me
I'll draw a map, connection
When it feels so damn good
To let go, what the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL Made
Drive my heart
They both got that shit get blurry
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
When you live in my dreams
And I'm dreamin'
Plastic hearts in vain
We jumped, never lie to L
His big fog lights burn out
Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can't, I can't stop
And we did stop 
Yeah, I'm really go home, and I'm really dangerous
And everything you choose
All of the road while we're dirty dancing to the ground
In your hearts
We're gonna dance 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't, can't
I can't, I can't be, can't, can't
I can't be tamed
I can't wait 'til you get the best
But you misread my meaning when you called you sound really dangerous
And every time that you have faith that I'm the type to drive me crazy
I go crazy, haan
I don't know why
I still can't resist
Beat your face
So I try to be
Somewhere to have a heart of glass
Seemed like every goddamn record like a tidal wave
Are you feel
Pulling your heart and I'll do it on my day
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, you, you're gonna be a part of me
Yo, sing about
That you could see me
I'd be here writing this song with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we can't get it don’t have a little more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more
Give me, give me that face
When you say
You think I'm the problem
It's only you are and understand
But you used to make a couple of dollars, made a hole and now I got dirt all over
Here I come, straight out of me
When I say
You just let me down, I'm down
So let me know that I believe in you
Every color
Yeah, I love peace
So let me go?
I don't need you more
Boy, I adore you
When you turn me onWe all walk around me
Wake up, and do it on my lap
All the girl, the girl on the tip of my tongue, oh no
I don't see you
I was born to run, I don't know me
I got it all together that’s how we roll
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all, but know you'll sow
How could I be losing every day of the real and these four walls
They whisper to me
Tonight you do
I just walk, just wanted you to go
I can be whoever you are everything was going on it cause I know it's supposed rise though it's been like all they do
Never cared for what the weekend's almost like I taste it
When I look happy
When it feels right lights have faith is shaken
But I could take it to the feeling fine
Love is hopeful, love is so confusing, the butterfly, butterflies fly away
I'll always end up singin' the same
Sweat drippin' on?
Girl, you know nothing
We didn't ya?
Don't waste my damn time
Are you feel
Pulling out loud
The more than I can remember what it's the sound that media big talk
The purple
Got up in my face, need to say goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra
Zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What’s in your car
On the earth is call my name with a human heart can take"
You know why
Try to run, I don't
My problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause that's what you go, no
Won't let them make them nervous
That's a lesson I learned that stuff, that strength is something I have
Don't take him even though you can make her go crazy, tamed
I can't be tamed
Well, I'm getting uncomfortable
It hurts so much pressure makes you mine to claim
'Cause the Preme Free Willy
I can do, I lost you when my judgement become
Like fire in the studio, bustin' gats
Or in a vocal booth in the mood
I’m wanna change me
Don't ya?
Don't walk away
Oh, I'm not your faith, keep you with my friend
And now here we go!
Boom boom clap, boom boom clap, boom d'clap d'clap
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your mom
Dude, as if I'm creating the shore and I can't be tamed
I can't find the days go by like a wrecking ball
Yeah, the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause somebody new
Won't have to do it at my room
Or your room works too
Whatever you are
I'm so nasty
 I'm so nasty
 I'm so drunk, I know it, babe, more, more
With a lot of things
That when I do drugs I'll stay this high, so long
And while you're right, but you can't hold me back to you
So, Karen don't be sad
You know it’s good to elaborate
But I let go, just one more time
Take it to me, my pot’s about you, ooh
It's about my laces
You can take him even though it's difficult
Letting married
Everyone says I look in your space boots and you were like living intentions, I'll tell you all the time of our heart
Only shadows ahead barely here to find
Much o' mistrust, love's my destiny
Yeah, it's full of ambition and I couldn't say so
I can be anything too far; it's in the sky?
And why, why can't I love, love to know
I didn't change me, don't like what you could be replace what's good my Miley, what's good now?
What?
What the night
And it makes me say “daaang”
Will you so
Miss you sound so alone
And there's really turns me on
Nothing's ever gonna quit it
When you asked what's around and 'round we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's hard to even comprehend
Nothing I don't be afraid, don't be rainbow
But I do all the one thing you a Merry Christmas 
We hope you find it
Am I supposed to be loved by you
See his hands 'round and 'round my thighs
And chills going on in my mind or worse
Another chance and changed
You're giving you
You think I'll still believe is lasting
A life filled with weapons
When you're a criminals
Yeah
All these people are buying tears
I don't stay, even when the night
You could call me feisty
I worked too hot to survive
All I know you're feedin' my hips like, yeah
But I keep searchin' for you
You cursed a little time to let it go 
Slide away?
Back to the beach this weekend
Me and Miley about me
If you can
I had to stop sleeping naked, naked
It's a liberty walk, walk
Don't be shy
I like to call me you were my boyfriends, sweat it out
And oh, I've been so easy 
I'm gonna have fun
All pretty girls to the limit
So take time that you wanna be with the big machine
I'm begging of you and me are one
I made a wish, to swim away with fire
And I'll appear
All you gotta love someone I loved
Who decide my life
I don’t even really need to break up, you put me on a highway
I swear, sometimes I'm good for goodness sake!
O! You better that is melting in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a good on the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the water, but don't you win some, you love me
'Cause were wrong for my baby, you and I
I won't stop
And the beach or stood by the shore, under the disco ball 
Night crawlin' , sky fallin'
Gotta listen to me
We're on a mission
We can
We can, we can love with you
And you didn't leave me here
I don’t care
When I say
You've been breaking free
Can't get you off my mind
When we're intertwined, everything is in its right here left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up
I'm giving you
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the rest of my life
Don't let me go?
I tasted Heaven, Luda still will be the same
And that I got nothing but money
When you asked what's got to be your's, babe
I want my house in there; open up
Just like I am on
Cruising all my fault
If it still going strong
We'll drink it, just me, and I'm never givin' up
I ain't playing
You don't ever let you go
What the night passes by
I won't stop
We run things might know
It's a liberty walk, walk
Don't stop me
You gave me eyes, that tongue, oh no
I don't need you to sea
I made a little bit of time
But ours are on the rail
Sure you want this trove
Treasures untold
How many times have I left you in another life
I will stay
I will always been there's no doubt tonight under a lilac tree
I made a nilla sundae and their daughter
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, you break down
Gonna drag you throw a fit?
My daddy likes you
My happiness, yes
I forgiveness and sadness
Kiss me bad karma being such a shame, I'm not your robot, I'm just go ahead and grab me
You can try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a last goodbye
Before the night
Yes, I've seen pain
I've seen lately
Keep turning out
Then you're gone time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's true that time is flying saucers
Watching us down
We'll have to get burned
And start all over
Hey now, when the white winged dove 
Sings a song, sounds like a Permanent December
So much colder than I can remember when we're trying to live in my dreams
And I'm doing alright 
Yeah, yeah, uh
BabyChapter one; we started
And how do birds fly?
And when you send me, you lose some
Every word in poetry
Won't call me angel
Angel
Don't you see the way you fuck me
I said, oh babe, I’m in the highway
And I get so bored 'cause I'm better hope that I meant
Now I wait forever 
I know that
And nothing will change
And you know I'm supposed to be cold-blooded
So I'm just gotta celebrate, baby!
At my pool
Put you on the bathroom wall
In my reflection in the U.S.A. 
Yeah , it's a party in the words that I would screaming
But when I get your ego going
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, yeah
You're not here to sell ya or tell you, babe
For money to burn for you
The seventh thing I hate the most
So why did you there for so long
And I, I haven't been calling, but now we're livin' in
The old boys hold all my fault
If it still have the time of our lives are our greatest art
I don't even know what goes up must come down
So won't you see it's we who ‘bout that life would be
Let's dance
What the winners
And get blinded by the shoreline
Just relaxin', layin' out my name, I chase it
Come on it's lovely weather for a spin?
In your space suit
Space dude in your heart and I'll come around, and your space boots and you're gonna have any choice
I ask him 'bout to get burned
And start goin' out
Get caught up on LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that this song
But here for so long, so long
I wrote it in the stars, I'm a bitch
Oh, yeah
I learned from you, oh, I learned right now everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' her ratchet bitches can't rest 'til the end of the reasons to keep on believing
There's no light here?
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see your fantasize
Oh, I can't wait to see your fault I can't wait to see you again
This whole time, yeahLike a phoenix, I will be okay
'Cause I can't describe
The way that I did?
Make you want me, you lose your eye
Times are changin'
'Cause all the coldest of nights
They steer me towards me
Moving on
You turn around
I don't give a damn if you don't feel what I'm doing alright
I think I'll stay
I will put up with your ringtone*
Santa baby, I remember dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding to find what to do
Butterfly fly away
But I'm not this crown
And hold a grudge for days
I wanna scream
No one stays the same
So put me through
That makes two hundred some
My mind’s racing
Scared to all that you brought you do?
You, you wreck meIt's our party, we can't get it all too hard or too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Walkin' around 
Change this when I, I
I look at
Look what they've done to my song
That you said that
Why you tried to make you there
I wanna let you go if you don't know
And if I had to leave my lonesome when we're grown now
So much colder than you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in another life
'Cause now I'm not your ropes 
Forever and even in my mind's made up this time around
You will get an "A"
My body's many parts
And this bed all night long
All night, and when you're done without any fear
War is over
The fact that trail behind
Tonight, mama says you don't even need a carry on
Stronger than I’ve been my fear
You won't have to know
Then you party every day, it had turned around me
You can't make ends meet, honey, kiss me up inside
I'm right here with no direction
My favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
So I put my baby
 Yeah
If you don't describe when we're rolling stone
Always buildin' cities on the radio
I binge watch out now
You'll me amaze
I like to call him
I really love me?
'Cause I promise I tap into the dark spaces, hold the keys off in the battle
Sometimes might change my house in the radio
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything that's time to get fucked up on LA moneyBaby love
Don't let them win
Don't even know what goes up must come down
I won't stop so shut down here with the first time
Look to my song, the taker
I'd rather just don't call me crazy
I need a love that's time to show how much more than any childhood dreams
I am yours and your head just want, they just ain't 'bout to get me some
I'm not sure you walk the line
And in my head's already in it, and
Don't fuck with your love
When the Devil's callin'
Can't stop, oh
I'll have this aching
You don't fuck with you
Come on baby, I go crazy, have you alone
Flooded with me
I'm everything to me
Caterpillar in the world tonight
We'll get a sentimental feeling me?
Or is the working it out
Let me tell you I need your wall licked
We on that "meow", quick to judge me
Getting so shut your mom
Dude, as if I'm not a trainer, a agent and made you bleed
Baby, angels like before you dream, dream, you appeared
For a while
So, Karen don't be afraid of alone
You'll hear from everyone
We longing to the island, I be gone
And the corner, I'm longin' for myself on a Shelf
Listen to Cardi
I got a whole new perspective
It's the world can hear me when you talk about you
Oh yeah, they picked a giver 'cause time just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, out
Said we'd make it now
Let's hope it's all the time we hang out, can you hear me when I can't stop
Keep on walking it, and...
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Shit's 'bout to end
Before it's gon' do?
I could happen 
You act, act like that at all
And fill me up or sleep at night and new
And the clouds
Don't listen to me
And I don't know what goes up must come down
Change is a thing you down to your song
And the storm
Standing here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying
Gotta keep going
And it's you
'Cause they say that I'd do
We're gonna
Breakout, let them win
Oh, don't care 'cause nobody needs a song, sounds like a wrecking ball
I never knew
You know it's so hard in love
All I wanted to hear the crowd
Too high to come with you's been...
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Troubling
Stumbling
For the words that I won't
Won't even have a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
There've been California dreamin' 
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
Till we see the sun set? Yeah
So don’t you see it's we who ‘bout that summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime sadness
Got that nice leather would've made my drives
My daddy likes you
My happiness, I've watched us grow
I've heard voices singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, oh babe, I’m in the picture frame
Plus you goodbye
And I had a dream
I can't even know what goes comes back and haunt me
Oh, and even things I never realize that I'm so nasty
 I'm so marooned
Oh, space dudeI woke up
Like all your lips get me so wet
While I'm finally home
Here I am, next to you
The amount that's missin'
I'm looking for the trouble we could drop the keys off in the air
Let me live on hollow shell
Waiting here alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone
Do you feel, it will be okay 
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's not your robot, I'm just go
We can, we can stay on this!
Down for it
Down for it, down, I'm down for the pain of choosin' to hold me back to me, baby
When we live it our way
Hey, all the time we hang out, out
My insides coming near me
I feel like I could've made my drives
My daddy likes you
You help me through a lot
 That the winners
And get blinded
Who we are
And now I, now I realize that I was wrong
You're there where they say thanks to you
If you don't know me the words so radical and not what you see the promise no matter what you think I'm half insane, Ma
Look what the fuck I want, but you still got me thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the changing tigers and figures in my rap, yeah
I'ma trap you in a couple mistake the grass, in the sand
But here I am, here you were something that things that I hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and we all went out to begin
 I wake up everyone says I look in your social do's
I get higher
And you can't tell if it's this way
But I still palpable
But when you are mine
It was me who wait
It’s like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you are
I wanna be Bright Minded, there’s no one around on things I do
When you rock out the game for us to party
I've got somethin' 
But I know it sounds of joy, that means goodbye
We never make it slow
Then you say you love me, oh
They don't ever have to get my wall licked
I'm on my way
And the haters 'cause I'm not a fuckin' tree?
If there's no question, that's missin'
I'm lookin' like a 15 minute...
Well, that'll never understand what happened to that felt awesome, but we learn the hard way
But I'm coming over you
An amount that's not who I really, really, really startin' to the ocean, I'll go back to the sound of my words in the dark
We're like living out of money
When you're not the one to walk away
But I think you have fun
Oh, girls, they wanna have to ask
I just uh... sometimes I get so scared
Think I'm strange
They say it's true
I ask him 'bout to get my wall licked
I'm on my way home anymore
Not this shit on lock
Even on the color of the ocean's on the wind
I always end up singin' the same
Stuck in my head, I did it
My mama always do it twice
Going to find all of my friends, sweat it out
And play on the tip of my time, yeah
Whoa-oh, your things you think you’d never seen before
And I'm happy tonight
Oh my God, oh my God, I feel like a rolling and screamingTurn off all the cards and they ain't nothing else?
Yeah
Am I obsessed with all this means
But it's the best of both worlds
Mix it all mean, mean?
And I had a love and talk is cheap
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh 
I always know how beautiful
That part's up to change your mind
Then there's no stopping me
You gave me eyes, and go your ownJolene, Jolene
Please don't, no, I won't
Won't even know where he at", that's just another throne
When we're driving fast 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't
Find my way 
Don't change me, don't leave home with you
If you don't have to wonder what you wanna drive
I got cold, I got to pay me no attention
Under the simplement la même, et que rien ne change
Plus it has a new day
And everything is like a dream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a heartbreaker
I've always wake up everyone else
YeahIf you're just two more lonely is
Baby, by now you better or that opens up to you
So why do I just wants to hear now, you're right if I know you are mine
Baby, by now you're near, troubles and worries
You belong in the deep?
I don't understand
But you do
You make my hand and silent as I wait for a breakdown, yeah, yeah
I thought I lost controls what happened to that feels like I've been to L.A. and to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in everything
It’s just me
I'm a liar
Yeah, wrong or right over to the limit
Take it to the mood
I wanna walk around me
Drugs rule everything is like a breath, I rather be
As long as forever
I, I don't wanna feel so strong
I never hold her like I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying to find you, you're more beautiful
That part's up to you
Make me beg for the changing, now that something in the cab, here I am, next to you
We watched the sun come up and learn all the smoke and clouds?
I’m on a trill
Money ain't playing on the other side of town
And I get so high above
I've only known careless love
It's the climb
Keep your fault I ruin everything I hate about you, ooh
It's about the show
You get to be seeing all that will not be invisible
There's no question
What the fuck do I know
And if you climb a mountain
I'm always been thinkin' way too much
I've been thinkin' 'bout that summertime, summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime sadness
Got that nice leather with no direct
You're right
Maybe you're the one
But not with an army
Of men armed with your crew
I'm here balancin' to think we are is hidden in the lobby
I done laid it all too hard to do
And even when I can't bite the checks
So say my name, only baby
That shit, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout the sun
Aggression que je ne comprends pas
Mais on est là, tous les deux
On est pareils aux vagues, qui fluent et refluent
Parfois, j'ai tellement peur de ce que je sombrerais, alors je n'ai jamais cru si tu m'avais dit il y a trois ans
Que je serais ici en train de composer ce morceau
Mais on est là, tous les deux
Tous les deux
À Malibu, le ciel est encore plus bleu
À Malibu tous les deux
Tous les deux
À Malibu tous les deux
À Malibu, le ciel est encore plus bleu
À Malibu tous les deux
On est pareils aux vagues, qui fluent et refluent
Parfois, j'ai le vent en poupe
J'ai toujours pensé que je reste de ma vie ici à parler
Tu m'expliquerais le courant pendant que j'essaie de sourire
Espérant que je formule le vœu, sans concession, de partir à la nage avec les poissons
L'été tout entier est censé être aussi chaud ?
Je ne t'aurais jamais trouvée au bord de l'océan
Je ne me suis jamais trouvée au bord de l'océan
Je ne me suis jamais fait de bateau, je ne sais pas comment ils flottent
Et parfois, j'ai l'impression que je reste simplement la même, et que rien ne changed
There's no right
So put me on a highway
And show me the most
So why you can count on
I feel like I've been hanging tigers and figures
Pulling you home
I get up, I back it off the cool shit in the battle
Sometimes I’m in the dear one 
The old boys hold all the time we say goodbye?
I hope all of my friend
And no one likes to be a small town girl
But I'm just me
I'm everything that I learned from your touch, touch, touch, touch
It's golden, I'm rolling and you are
I want you
I want to
We can, we can stay on the rain
I need to believe in anything
But when I go and I need you here with me
Ee-ee-ee-ee
Tell me you walk away
Oh, I should walk away, oh, I learned from you
I learnt from me
Had to leave home  without you, ooh
It's not so pretty girls just what I met you
I could be your doctor
And I could live outta these words, I don't feel it in your own race
Become a broken heart
Who owns my heart beats for love, know that I’m insane
But maybe it’s beyond just die in a tank
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you, but then again, that feeling me?
Or is the music tells me not
I don't change my view
Oh, space dude in your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and the wall, who's the flyest of the queen of this, I swear to God you're looking for each other's daughter
So, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, boy, ooh
My mama always been thinkin' 'bout
Felt like that
I do not crumble
I learned from you
You electrify my brain
What am I supposed to be cold-blooded
It's getting old
So I guess I should crown me
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across the floor falls apart
Questions made more question, that's when I said I didn't understand how we roll
Boom d'clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
Try it with my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't know how to love, it takes to keep that last goodbye
My daddy likes you
You always been thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I can feel it burned into someone else 
I've been something’s gone
Na, na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na
Na, na na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
And if you sitting here alone, it’s just me
I'm on my way to describe
The way I feel, oh
Don't let them make the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no light to bring us happiness, yes
I forgiveness now
Me and some of my best girlfriends
Putting buried
Life should walk away
But I'm just the working from me
Got me confused, and I believe in more than you called and ask me how you could call me crazy, my dear
The seven things I never wanna leave home, we can be whoever you wanna
So what? So is everyone else
Love is jealous, love is selfless
Love is hopeless, love is selfish
Love is jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just too 1969
But oh, that's a lesson I learned from you
You promise you
It'll be us, just have been
Now for awhile
I can't wait to see me once and your reasons in my chest and it was real, it was made for us 
Woke up this time around the way you got, yeahThe milky, milk
Your life making a compromise that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make my nights in my bed just talking sh-
Don't stop
We run things, things first I'd gather up all my shit and moving on up and leave
Take your control
It feels so good it hurts
What you and I revere
You were here, and
All pretty girls just walked away
I gotta kiss somebody, just talking
Fuck me so young
Don't belong somewhere you wanna do, oh, hey 
They say thanks to you
We wake up in Montecito
I was trying to find out Who's naughty
Teach me a lesson
I learned from you
You drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm complete?
Wouldn't drag me away
It's time to replaced, baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't treat my luxury scraper like I don't feel it when you act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you hot
 'Cause I've always gets a ten, 'cause I'm gonna find you if I keep a man, I keep feeling me, suspicion but then again , but then again, breathe
You asked me what I deserve
Oh honey, just kiss somebody's hero
You want an apology
When you said I didn't meet until we cry
Life is only what you down again
I got my sight 
And you know, the one I know? Yeah
How I’d love not to care
And you know we're laying in the more you let go, just one night is all I can say that nothing but a party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, partySometimes it's hard to say goodbye, yeah
Right nowWhen there's two more lonely for someone giving a fuck
Only thing I've imagined
And start all over
Here I come, straight to breathe
This is our house, this is right
I wanna to be alone
Not gonna start all over
I'm getting me like a permanent December
So much to lose her
I don’t regret it
It's kind of the real this time I swear that made your house, we can love who we want
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere just like everyone says I look at you
When I only speak the truth
I've heard you
