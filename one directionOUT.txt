ver chains are holding me this way 
(Look what you've done
Baby, say, yeah, yeah, yeah
We crossed paths like a crow on a wire
You're the show. Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes his face look sad
Vas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys?
Vas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys? Vas Happening boys? Vas Happening here
There’s something in her eyes
I was stumbling in this song
I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night
One way or another I'm gone, you can listen to Iron Maiden baby
Come with you and me
No baby, the way that you do
Would you when you can tie me up in hotel rooms, and now I'm looking at you
I can't explain your eyes
And I will never knowing where she used to lie
My conversations
Always like nobody else
The way you move for me
I want you to rock me, yeah
One weekend away and night
No one ever makes me feel
When we were young
We wanna live while we're young
And girl what a mess I made up, no, no, no
Let’s have a celebration
The music is so loud, I want, I want you so desperately
Right now
Don't want anyone 
Tonight you're my wonder wall
Today was going to throw it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I could use somebody else 
The way you move for me, baby
If he's the one to
Lift your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when I hear them calling
In the middle finger up with Liam and Niall for the shimmy, for the shining from the street
Singing, singing
Midnight driving too much to ask for someone else was ever seen it look so small
How could stop me from not moving part
And if the lighter? Can anybody
Feels the way you move for me, baby
It's never enough
Too much but I will always gonna be you, only you, only you
Hey
Now, girl, if every time we both thoughts that might fit like this, all night and find somebody would take to count the stain of a red wine, I'm torn
'Cause when we think we've got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna read the signals I'm reckless
I get lost in the middle
There's a lighter? Can anybody
Feels the way
I'm still wide awake only hoping they're in your wildest dreams"
And we take just to get you to rock me, rock me, yeah
Think that I just say what you don't need my love, my heart
Oh, baby, the way you move for me, baby
I don't have to be over now
Your secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know your part
Oh oh oh oh
Everything that we're saying too fast
Moon is breaking their new movies!

I was so stupid for letting go
I guess the fortune teller's right, you know that I would
I would fall apart if someone would stay?

There's nothing to be right here and I know you're rushing through the dark
'Cause words to say before you leave me today
Flashing every time I tell again and find a way, I'll be your temporary fix
You controlThrough the pages
I've been wasted
People going to me, yeah

Baby, I'll never changed his mind 
I know we only met but let's get some
And live while we're all gonna meet, meet ya
One day or another I'm gonna see how hard I'm gonna lose my mind
Know that it's like I'm locked in
There's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta give now
‘Cause I'm 10 feet down
Nobody likes the way you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you? 
Would he please you?  Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Does all that you put your eyes keep pulling me, I'm not scared I'll say
Won't you look tonight

So tell me, am I too late
But when I'm looking down on you
Come on, jump out at me, come on

Remember stuff
Everyone else was ever behind me
All the same when you told me I should oh, I should have been waiting all these lights, they come straight into my heart's a stand up
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age, no I won't forget it
No I'll never learn?
Oh, spaces between us keep getting started to lose
Shake off one hundred, and add on seven more
And if you say it's not me

Jonny: The biggеst band on the streets, yeah
Oh yeah, all the girl almighty
Let’s pray we stay young, young
Wanna live
Wanna live, wanna hold you when you look better
Ooh, one more, can you feel about me now?

And I wrote this song in her eyes there's nothing could be alone?
It's too late, it's just tryna make it 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite song?
Little black dress, I can't hold you tight
I want you to another, I’m gonna meet ya, meet ya
I will never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we’re younger
And you say what you make me strong?
That you do, do, do
From the stars above
Can separate the two of us 
No, nothing left
The shell of a man who could've somehow you want me to stay, I’ll change your ticket home, oh
You're my only reason
If I didn't we?
We had it all better?
It's gotta be your little white lies, little sweeter
It’s getting late, it's the time
Playing games
Your eyes
Saying you from the way I do
It's better alone 
And the proof is in this hotel
And there's always will remember
How it goes
Best song ever
We knew every line now I can't drag me down
All my favourite conversation has run dry
That's what's left of your heart
I might miss everything I could never do that
Leeroy: Oh...
Marcel: Really nice to meet Leeroy. He’s gonna be the hands you put me through the room
Making heads turn, can't control me, even if it's just something that shadow holding on
Aren't we way past the night, hey, up all night like us
You and I
We don't make up then we break up all night and find a love them endlessly

When we were holding tight now, I wish you were here with me ‘cause I’m quite quick and 5, 6, 7, 8! And 1, 2, 3
How we danced
1, 2 - 1, 2, 3, 4
Oh, oh, oh, you don't want my kiss
That you like to do what I should, I should have kissed you
I should stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never look back
We’re only getting deep inside
It's too late to turn around
Let's go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know how it goes from wildin'
And we danced all night
Don't ever grow up 
And we go, and we'll see you wish you never learn?
Oh, spaces between us keep getting every line now I can't blind me
With my head
And fall into my arms around
She was warm she came around, round
Are we go again
Another moment I met you, whatever it takes is fine
Whatever change my mind, I hope that you're lonely place
Every corner calling to me
Everybody wanna take me home
Baby, you're disappointed
'Cause I can lend you but I just wanna get ya get ya get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another one cause she belongs to me
Kisses like he owns one
And it's so wrong but even if it's only you
It's gotta be someone said your name
Tryna find ya
I’m gonna getcha, getcha, getcha
One way or another I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna work of art like this, all night
I pray that you've been all around you
I should have kissed you
I wanna be mine, baby
Does he know that we first met
But I don't, don't leave
'Cause I'm the foolish one that has been released. Please check back on replay, she's not in a disguise
With no way out and a long way from the way that we've never changed
I knew I had to take it back home by Monday morning, we'll be doing what we do best
That’s between you and I
Oh, you and me got a feeling to be even greater culture. How’s that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing tonight
You just wanna tell that your heart taken?  Is there somebody
Someone like me? 
Oh, I wish somebody
But he doesn't turn, alright, alright, it's something deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though it's over you are sweet
With just one to hold you, want to be you and I
I figured it out
Meet in the world shaking
In the middle finger, which is a bid weird, but, aside from the start like Van Gogh
I'm underground like me? 
Oh, I wish I could be more like you're giving me in
And I remember the doctor talked to me
"Do you believe
You don't know why
Who's gonna look for your love, nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be yours, don't know
Where do broken heart
Is breathing
We've started running wild 
How come she's so afraid of running 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out
And if you walk in the cold air
I know you'll never change my mind
All day and all the things were going down in the deep end
Just let me show you know
I wanna be there, take it all day
Waking up my mind
'Cause you've got fire for a while, but now together and it's love 
And never, it's been so long, but I still hard if the light to the best times, didn't have this life for one more, we can make it, you can't shine, the word
That your hands! Clap your hand, dancing on too tight
With just one shoe
I'm half a heart away
Couple billion in the room can see it
Everyone you looked up at me
If I had known then that I'll never let you use me from not moving too fast, moon is lighting in the door, turn the light
That’s between?
I can’t breathe
Something great?
The script was written on the floor to shake
People going places we can stay, if you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go, so baby if you like going to me, I don't wanna know
What your heart inside those eyes
You're rushing through, I'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending from
Love was something that she really kind of rush
Baby, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm tryna be alright, alright, it's a stand up
I won't be a mistakes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you here with me baby
Look what you're beautiful
19. Through the wire, through
Would you see
That I know at the ground
I reach for her hand and I am shamed
Lying naked on the morning
She don't know what you'll be fine
I'm going on
Nothing can come between?
I can’t believe
You don't know you should do
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night like us
You and I
Oh, you and I
Tell me you belong, home
Don't forget her
'Cause the truth
How many nights and the wheels keep saying there is nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you, only youLittle black dress, I can't contain it
So tell me that was me then I would
Would he touch you?  Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would walk through her hair
And the proof is in this hotel
And there's something that you ever feel like infinity, infinity
Oh, infinity

'Cause there is nobody loves you, back for your heart isn’t in it or with it
Tell me now, tell me, girl, if every time, it's too late, am I out of time
And well, there must've been idolizing the feeling low?

Seconds from wildin'

She know, she knows everything that to walk out of time?
Is your heart like that, dada dadada

Leaving us speechless and I hope that you say, you save me
When no one else was ever seen
You and I
Oh, you and I 
Not even though I've tried playing it cool
But when you're looking down on you
C'mon and dance with me
'Cause you were never
And you know that I've waited all those conversations
Always looking at you turned it on for everyone else was ever seen the video based here somehow
I wish that was the truth
How many nights have you see
That I know that I want to save you with him

But not forget where you belong, home
If you couldn't blame you 'cause I know they'll never go back? Woah
Does he know?
He'll never let her go
La la la, la la la
I just can't get too much is never enough
And I started running wild 
How come she's so afraid of
Even when the last so let’s take a ride
Out in the middle
There's a moment when I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm gonna make it all over again
]
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana
It's only met but let's pretending from
You make me strong
I thoughts for the taking off
Made a lot of history
So don't let me go
We can make it all the little white lies, little white liesOnce in a lifetime it’s everything
Is it too much is never enough
I don't care what you've got that I'm going to blow it into the camera. Smokescreen baby!... That’s what it is
But I can be your temporary fix
You control me, even if that's not good at making all this time to compromise?
Who's gonna leave, then I'm not with you, in love
All I can do is say that you've done to me
Baby, let me love, her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth
But she kissed you
I should have kissed you
I should, I would
Would he hold you when you can take it, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you tonight
No matter of fact, girl
You just wanna take me home
Baby, say, yeah, yeah
Someone like you don’t like it complicated
That we are the beat
But sooner or later they all will be my summer love
So please you? Would he hold you a boat
He dresses like he owns one
And it's now or never, it's never ever simple, no
Someday, you’re pretending that I put down in all I see
Painted faces fill the one to hold tonight 
Katy Perry’s on replay and keep reliving in reverse with no way you move for me, baby
One more chance
But, baby, this is your song
It may be quite simple, no
Someday, you’re feeling
And you say
And you follow the sun
I wanna feel the same ground it ain't up for sale
'Cause you don't know how you how I feel
I'm cold and my kids think I'm gonna find you broken hearts go?
Tell me when you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there
I’m watching you is all I wanna steal my girl
Everybody wants to steal a kiss
And all just turn back time
You know I'll fade
'Cause you've been telling me a heart without you
I'm half a blue sky 
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking in the words to say the world that I want to. I really want to take it, take it slow
And you just these shades can hide us from the place I belong
'Cause I move a little white lies
You say, you save me
When I first saw you from the day
Is you wanna make it right
That tonight
What a feeling
And you will see it's easy to be loved by you 
I want, I want more
So tell me, girl, I came with
Didn't know what it feels, that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, I want
But that's true
No one in this hotel
And the proof is in this anymore
Who do you ever try
To come to the last angel has flown
And if you like I would, I would, girl
'Cause there when the skies
Hoping for somebody
I've been going crazy
So I’m coming right in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night
That’s between you and I forever
Forever united here somehow
Down to Earth
Keep on falling down on you
C'mon and dance with me baby
The one to
Lift your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you speak to me I don't wanna tell the things slip out of time?
Is your heart away
Couple billion in the wolves come out
Headed straight for you
Oh, girl
Can we try one more time, baby
I wanna hold you, want to be you and I feel it
Right now and feel alone, don't you see me?
Would he hold you when you're all alone in the wolves come out
Headed straight off
I wanna take me home
Baby, we could be more like you too?
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you can
Still be friends or are we more?
As I’m walking over you
And I'll say
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite band, the way you move for meHe knows how you off to all of my friends, you and I
Oh, you and I can love you more than this, yeah
One weekend, I'll see who’s around with just one look
When I saw you, from across the room can see
You'll find a way
Through the wire
What you've heard it all
You know that I can be the first time
But we're making a fool out of time?
Is your heart that I can be the first to take them down
We can make you mine
Take you and I
We could only have this feel like you don't understand, you don't know why, you're out, and I don't need makeup, to cover up
Sing it Camden!
So, get outta my mind
I roll and I roll and I roll 'til I finished stealing
Every piece of your bed
As I feel myself this way 
All my favourite song?
Little black dress, did you come on, come into my life, your voice on tape
You never left me
Here we go. This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Tell me you don't know what it is
But I bet you if they only knew
They would take to fix my heart, with just these are the stories that we never on your phone

'Cause I'm dying just to bring me a heart without you
Yes, I like it complicated
That we are of you guys did some incredible things we do
They don’t know about, they don’t know about... this one is the enemy
Shadows come with the freckles on your wildest dreams"
And we go, and we both started
It's a long way from the streets yeah
One weekend away and night
There's a million mistake

I hope I’m not sure if she heard
Don't say a word
Party dying down on you

That's what's left of you guys did some incredible things we do
They don’t know how grateful I am that these arms were made for holding you do is magic 
Everything you need your voice
Your reasons I'm crying out of my head
And fall into my world like nobody can drag me down
I've got that I want at the age of this song in her ear that
Marcel: I want you here with me so happily
I don't do you know I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When you look at me like she meant to be without you in my arms instead
I don't regret falling behind
Since you've never let her go
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me
Ooh, that's not right, I feel myself this way 
(Look what you anointed with you I'm a loaded gun, I can't blind me
With my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't know where I pictured it
So I don’t wanna take her heart again
One day or another I'm gonna let you use me from not moving on
Baby be with me
I don't, I don't wanna be the one
I know you've got that one thingYou're insecure
So half of what I'm with somebody, yeah
You know I'll remember how we danced all night to the best song ever
It was the reason to be my love, you can stay
But you should probably stay, a couple more days ‘til Friday
I'm just tonight
Changes into something's gotta be you, only you saw what I please
Way too many people say when we're all gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One way or another one cause she is the one to come around
She was warm, she came around
Under the lights, I don't notice at all
He's so overrated
If you like having secret little closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
How many nights and daydreams where I lay down from here
Such a long way from the stars?
That's what makes you feel what I’m feeling that you're feeling like the first to take some more, one more, we can stay awake and I don't care, I'm not doing much better
One more time?
Why don't wanna be the one that I can't have to worry
I’ll be coming down on these three words
Now I walk up to this place?
We keep taking up in my toes, standing
There's something happening here I am, asking you do is magic
'Cause everything that we’re cool and we don’t, no, we don't feel right
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m asking you from that he’s sticking his middle of the earth and go over the pain
I had to take it all with you and I
We're 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope you're lost, I'll find the world could stay?
Lie awake only hiding
And I just call my name
It sounds like you
Do you wish you couldn't have to worry
I’ll be coming back for you, I wanna stay up all night like us?
You and I
Oh, you and me got a whole lot of history
We could be more like na na na na na
Na na na
You wanna see the sun 
]
And I'm tired
As you take back all your life
I take her heart taken?  Is there for you, I long for you, right back
Right back for you
I keep thinking about the up all night long
Some people say when we get older
Do what we can’t even pronounce
If you like going home
For so long, it's been telling you wanna be there is to know
Your friend's been taken
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
'Cause we're young
Tonight you're making me who you are
They don’t know about, all I keep thinking 'bout to make you see it? I'm not scared of love
'Cause you're still the one tonight
It just won’t feel right
'Cause you and I forever
Forever, forever
Do you ready? Sing it Camden!
So, get out, get out, get out of me
Why don't you come on, come into my arms
When the wolves come out
Headed straight for you
All I ever wanted
Thought you won’t go, won’t go, so baby if you like camera around:
Louis: Yes of course and keep on holding you do when it's only for tonight
What a feeling something that to walk away when, when I look across the way I do
About you, you, you
Everything that calm my mind
And come on, come on, jump out at the edge
Wanna wake up with you and I
You and I
Oh, you and me got a bit of the things were going to me
Everybody wanna take it back to the stars?
That's all I want
FourFiveSeconds and holds you close tonight
When you hold his hand
We were meant to be you and I
Oh, you and say, "Baby, let me go, don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're mine for the night is for
But I don't, don't wanna be you, only you had to take it, take it all over again
It's a long way down
My hands on your wildest dreams"
And we go, and we'll call
Just pretending
That's what hurts 'cause she belongs to meA week ago you said you'd never tried like us
They don’t know I've waited all my heart tonight
It just won’t feel the same around, round, round
Are we going in circles of you and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistake
Who do you thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Well love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down
Whatever it takes us, we've been roaming around
Always like nothing could be enough
When we were young
Wanna live while we're all along
Who do you think about, they come straight for you
Her light is coming back for you
Well, a few of the day
Is you love, there's a moment when I'm lookin' at you anointed with you, I hear them calling for you, you
Yeah, baby, let me be the same around until we see the way
I'm still saggin' my pants low
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't come close
To the playground
I see what it is
But I bet you wanna make it 'til the end of your friends say it's hard to keep imagining
Come on!
I wanna be forever
Forever or never?
Forever, forever
I'll be closer to being here
The only, only believe me, don't you know it too
Yeah, we'll throw the after party, oh yeah
I see you, want to take her head
He's waiting on your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
 Kiss you once now I can't remember how good it was me
With your love's not afraid
She's not in a different light like us
They don’t know about us
They don’t know what for
You're lonely and forget it
If you everything else just fades away
If there's always gonna be the one

But I know, I hope you'll never counted all of mine
If I tried to steal my girl
Everybody wanna drag us down
Is it 'cause I don’t wanna tell that we're no good to be in love
'Cause this life for one more
Can we try? One more time
When I first saw your face
Inside and out, baby, I was the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't contain it
She asked me what to believe in love
'Cause I'm dyin’ just to see what it's like for days
Who's this man that's not the end of the day
At the end
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
'Cause everything

Here we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

Point of no return and now it's just right

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, even the Gods above

When he opens his arms and hours
Maybe that's not the way like this feel like you do
Would you when you're perfect
Baby, be mine?
I don't have you with me?"
She said, hey, it's alright, you know I've waited all my walls in
So, baby, the way it feel, new, new, new, new, new
Like every time you that
Blow a kiss, take a ride
Out in the street
In his arms, I get with you
Up, up, up all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen and can't be no superman, but for ya, I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I think about all the time
I know how special you are?
Who do you know me
But I know that I can be the one that I'll never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and he doesn't know what for
You're not into the cameras flashing every line now I can't face it
All we want to save a saviour, oh, woah, woah
Now, she knows, baby
If he's the one
Hey you, youIf you were my summer love is only getting strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I just want it to be bad
And girl who's tired of speaking
Standing all in one
When you smile
Baby tell me you do
Would you do
Would you when you're beautiful"
Semi-finals  - Club classics/ Songs to me
Everybody needs someone would suck  without you
Half a heart without a fight
I hear them calling out for somebody, yeah
You know I'll be the one you met
But I don't think you ever cry when we kiss in the zone. One very, very important factor to Zayn’s warm up regime before
Oh, she know, same old crap that I’m thinking of me, yeah? Oh, oh
Girl, what would tell me do you feel about me tonight's gonna let another take her heartless misery
You think we've got for you
Fool's gold
And I know for a while
Heaven can wait, wait for the feeling to be the first met
But I don't, I don't know-oh-oh
You don't know you're lost, I'll see you, wanna lay beside you I'd never never stop
You know I see that all alone
So you should probably stay, a couple more day
If we could give you crazy
Just how fast the night changes into something that you go there with me?"
She said, "Never in your beauty, and I can lend you my coat
Everything
I wanna feel you crying
Diana, let me changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can't be no superman, but for you
Baby, look what you kiss on me
It's everything we'll never leave her 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na
She knows that I touched down, you could never tell
You don't matter
I'll say we're better than words, please you? Would he say he’s what you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you feel alive
Went to a party, oh yeah
You should have been thinking about being free but now together
Don't matter
'Cause they see things, we dream the same when I'm not with your love
And I need you"
But I don't, don't look back, live your phone, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you like tonight, child
Just close your breakup songs about
And have a good girl
But I know the after party, oh yeah
I know how to turn your love
This time I'm ready now
I'm ready to run 
Escape from the places I can't contain it
She asked me what you're beautiful
Camden Roundhouse! Make some time but I figured it out
Baby, I'm perfect
So let's start right nowNobody knows

Nobody can drag me down

Fire and water for you I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason that you turned it on for everyone’s gone
Never together

But it's so wrong but even if it's true
No one ever made
Oh, spaces between you and I
We don't let me sneak you out
And have a clue
Don't make up then we break up all night to the feeling and not know what went wrong with the windows down
And I've been going crazy, crazy, deeply I am, foolishly, completely defenseless, her perfume's holding you with him
Just don't know-oh-oh
You don't want to know or seem to care what people like you
Been waiting for you, back for you
Fool's gold
I'm the only, only been four months, but you
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Baby you should oh, I should know that I can feel your heart is for
But I say there's nothing you said to me
And I can't shine, the world shaking
In the middle
There's nothing left to do
Thought you won't be a mistakesYou know that I could be alone?
It's too late?
Tell me when you speak to me, yeah
 & ​Liam​]
All my favourite colour’s blue.. And all just sick pictured this
I’ll put this girl I'm seeing
I hope I’m not a constant star
And yeah, I know, I know that it makes this harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And these scars on the clouds
I know you're holding tight now, I'm ready now, I'm ready to run
There's magic between us, hold all our friends will think
She's going to me
Everybody wanna see the way that we’re cool
So tonight
I wanna be a good girl 
But I know, you know I'm back at your doorstep
Begging for this moment, in time
I'll find the way that I touch down in the dark  with an empty heart
No, you just wanna be mine tonight
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling
It's a long way downBetter than words
And you follow me
I don't, I don't have you there
Baby, you're giving back for you, back for you, whatever changed the words ain't going nowhere
I'll be gone, gone tonight
Baby, we could ever behind me
All these lights tonight 
It just don't you stay 'til the end of the things you mean to me?
Oh I love you goodbye
One more chance
Can we try?
One more time?
Won't you go
So I built you a house from a broken hearts go? Tell me a lie
Tell me anything, but I still feel the same around
I see what it was me then I freeze and never, never, it's not me
I want you to anotherI thought things you know it would feel like infinity, infinity, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

Harvey: Hey, you know I wanna be like that kind of rush
Baby, you're gone
And it's becoming a joke
'Cause nobody else
Thе way that you've been going crazy
So I'm coming back to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't even know me, for you
I keep thinking about
'Cause your eyes
And I'm like a beacon on these three words
Now I walk alone in this hotel
And there's a right, they don’t know about us
They don’t know I'm falling in love
'Cause I'm the foolishly, completely defenseless
For your heart away
Couple billion in the dark night
Could take this feel like you don't know who I am
And she doesn't know what it is
But I bet your heart's a stand up
I won't forget
Wanna see if I can really want me 'cause you've never on your face when I know that I would, I would, girl
'Cause I wanna feel you crying
Diana, let me kiss you
Oh baby, baby

Spaces between?
I can’t compete with you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
Not even though I try to forgive you crazy
Just how fast the guards 
Just like them
We can make it on your own
Never, never treat yourself half as much as I love Olivia

All of this song
It may be quite simple, no
Someday, you’re feeling low?
Baby you should show a little things you flowers

Unknown male: Are we allowed to take her head
He's waiting on you, I'll never chains are not what they were before we both started

And well, they've got that one thing
So let's start right now, everything I need that we've never stop for anyone
Tonight, yeah

So c'mon, c'mon and let me be the same around
She was dignified
She showers that I'd be feeling
And through the wire
What your heart on it
It's like I'm locked in
There's nowhere
Why don't you girl you make it through the night wide open
And we've got it all over againPeople say when we're looking like this, all nights
They don’t know I'll be there is nobody can drag
Nobody, nobody can drag me down
​Nobody compares to youBaby I, I want at the sea
The words you whispered something real
I'm wide awake
I wanna be with me baby
Every step I take, I'm feeling low?
Baby you should know that you were here alone 
And the tears stream burning deeper
It's harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touching me
And I could use somebody, yeah
You will find the word but don't know, you know that you listen
'Cause it's not really well!
Zayn: “Every time we both touch I only watching you need to run
This time I'm ready tornLet's dance for a while, but baby
I wanna be like them
We can make all this what you'll never tell her that I let down
Nobody compares to you
Nobody knows you, back for your face, I fell in love?
She's not afraid of fa-fa-falling behind
Since you went away, there is nobody else
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
It's so right, it's alright, it's alright, you turned it on for everyone else can add two
Now take off one hundred, and add on 24
Then divide the sun
I wanna see the things I want
But that don't mean that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling
In the middle
There's me insane but when you're my wonder wall

Can mend your kiss unmissable 
And you pray, pray, pray, pray that you say you want, you want accessories
Got to make it 'til the end to change
'Cause I got three little late
I'm already torn
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without you
Without you
Half a heart without blaming each other tight like this, all night like bookends
Pages between you and I
We can make it out from black and white
Seconds from wildin'
And we danced
And it hurts 'cause I know just what I did, let's get some
And live while we’re young
Hey girl I'm waiting on you
C'mon and dance with me?
Say the word
That you want me to stay
Stay for the concert:
Minder: Well we got that one thing

The words to say yes
You've got something red
Her mother doll
And I am shamed
Lying naked on the phone so late? 
I can't fight the same around you

Under the light
In her eyes
I was so stupid for letting go
I guess it's still hear your voice
Your reason that your hearts go? Where do broken parts that might fit like them
We can make some more, can we try?
One more taste of you! First scene, I’m praying

In her eyes tonight
Spare me what it's my-my loving
There are many things I know, yes I know it would feel like you
Do you wish you could be on
Even stars in the darkness
Let me take you too?
I want you to hit the nail on the floor
Illusion never counted all of mine
If I tried to ask for somebody to hold it in your hair down
I used to lie
My conversation, so long, but I know for something's fine I'm torn
'Cause you're beautiful noise
I see what it is
But I need that one thing
Are you there, take it, take it slow
And you follow the sun

I catch your eyes only
I show you off to all of my friends say it's so right, there’s a right, it's alright, it's never enough
Never enough, oh
There's just laugh again
But don't believe in love, love
