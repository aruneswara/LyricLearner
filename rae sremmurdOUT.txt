Lit, lit, might spend a ticket
See if these hoes don't want no problems
So back to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, fuck you

Hey, Lame niggas like to pour champagne like a tantrum 
Nigga I am the gorilla of the cab, tell 'em let my mama tell it, so I put in work, this the You Can't Beat Nic zone
Madison Square when they say, "Who is that?" 
Oh, that's a very hard choice

They lose it when the insecurity sets in
You know my trunk pull up to SunTrust
