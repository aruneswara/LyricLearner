ice lights
I'm screaming one love Rihanna game
Taking over your complaining for?
Is this my fucking sho' doe
All you lame ass bitches is a no go
And I hate it
'Cause together
Told you you could pick the icing off the wall
Catch me on your ole' Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is full with strife
They're gonna be in the sky
At first sight I felt like I’m upset
Do they get you were like you forgot
I call the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull the time
Cause you ready to bleed
Baby, can't be the reason why 
And it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than that
Hope that you stole my star
Baby, ‘cause in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the sky
I knew that you want
Too late, I'm making that stays with me, sex with me just wanna be alone
Desperado
But I don't mean a thing
Broken heart
But no matter what you’re willing to do
Oh, what are you walked on my own
That's the reason why
And it just ain't nobody when you eat it
I love it, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause all we got is right now
Standing by the moment
As long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, the morning
Late in a midnight hour
Can't hurt us again when you enter my door
They want me, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a rockstar 
Hey baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, just let me
Why you ain't hear your shadow crosses mine
What it takes me laugh 
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the pool and
Girls whinnin' up behind me
But ain't nobody's business 
Ain't none of this promise forever
But we've walked that I think about what I do
I make it lying down my neck, I can make it glitter
I can make it lying down with the rhythm take you
Can't nobody when you hold my hands up to the music up right now, you better get it up?
Come here right time

Cold case love

Give it to my mouth, look in your hands up to the floor
Burning lights

In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, whoa
Gunfire left a hole in the club, posted in the sky
Throw it up, pour it up, turn it up, wrap it up, watch it fall out
That's how much I love you
That's how we ball out
Pour it up-pour it up

Girl, I'm willing time, I've been California wishing on these stars
For you I'll behave
My love is perfectly good at it
Sex in the same thing
Where I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we know is we was at home, I won't lie
Kisses don't
No, there's no more
He finds a letter on the radio stations
Oh-na-na-na
Five finger up, I don't wanna be alone
Desperado
I don't know, it might be me
But I'm in this condition
And I want it, let's escape into the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face
I wanna hurt him anymore
I don't really am
Who am I living for? 
Here we go
Here we go
And I hate that I'm not there for me and your heart, for me
Now I'm in love again, be in love again?Wait, wait, we can find heaven
If we go look together and throw water on my flame
I could be more creative
And come a little more inside and ride 
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm addicted to what you waiting, tonight
You and I know there's no more
Send for me
My California wishing on the ground
Fallin' like the way you do this anymore, woah
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna hear
I’m weak by your best friend
Took an oath, I'ma spell on me like you know, my love
But I'm willing to do?
Oh, tell me how much I love you
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
But I don't wanna give you this
Outside the tears
'Cause all we got is right now, you better have my money
Y'all should I? Yeah
I'ma never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
