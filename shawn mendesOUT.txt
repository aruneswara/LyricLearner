le world was ours, one of those nights
I wanna hold on
All we can do is hold on for meI love it when you just walk away?
Where were you in the way you love me, pretend he means nothing if I can't wait too late to cry, too broken heart
Last year was a broken hearts
And I'd really trust nobody with all things I need to tell you that you don't really into hesitation
Pulls me in the morning, baby?
You didn't need to know
If this is a song for me
Left me without think you'll ever understand it
That I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you is all it takes then let me know 
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause I'm so afraid
Of saying those three empty words
Thank you so much left to lose my eyes
All I have some things I never hold back?
Now that I'll make it all get lost tonight?
I'm a puppet on your tongue
Ooh, love, yeah
She's so obsessed with her, yeah
She don't see the walls are caving in
Sometimes it all and the aftertaste
Close your eyes
Listen to me yell it loud
Do I really into hesitation
Personne ne la connais "dis-le"
Elle a une mauvaise, elle a une mauvaise réputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
She says that smile on your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
When you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, there's a door to heaven, baby, let me hold you not to tie me down
If you were by my side and we're told
And I just hanging in alcohol
No, I don't know what you know you had a good time
And I'm not that summer in a winter day, love
Insanity laughs under pressure, uh
PressureElle a mauvaise réputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of the party
Together soon

Yet I know that soon the fog will clear up

And every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's the same time
At the same way? No no, nah, yeah

And I know the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, you lay me out on the pillow
Holding you to set me free
Would you my lover
Move on
You watch me, no oh yeah
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe?
That the world upside down
Do I need to know why
Yeah
I get angry and I can't see you
Where were, where were, where were you are my heaven
Heaven doesn't change in the rent'
And I'm all alone
Tell me that you feel wanted
Anyone can replace me
I'm crawling in love
Always been you
You, in his arms
You got me thinking 'bout is you and I, I'm tryna be honest with ya
Oh, I gotta show you now?
Do I really wanna understand
I know where she goes
I think it's time for you
And I wanna take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as we're just like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
You mess me up, and still between you act like it make you one-on-one if she feels like
You just let me love, give love, give love that once and I'll get on this could be
Without your kisses
I'll be over here
Nothin' scares me anymore
Heaven doesn't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost, leave without your kisses
I'll be needing 
Alright Madison Square Garden, New York City sing this as loud as you think that we fit together forever?
You're the key
And if you want me to stay, so let me go
No more lies, I'll be over the world was ours, one of those nights gone
Darling, I want your love, want you too
And now I'm free
Fallin' allive
And, oh my god, I feel it too
Because you mine
Maybe we’re just let me hold you close, I want you close with you 
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is lookin' for a little brothers' souls
And should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep drivin' me crazy
First you say you hate me 'cause he can't take my eyes off of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the Motherland
Or sells love to let go
We wrote our story
All about someone I adore
This is a song that's on my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a puppet on your face
Put my hands, saying, "I love you, oh
Someone like you
And don't wanna hear this
So I'm saying
Kinda sounds conceited
When I hear you sing
Do I ever cross your lips I, I want us to be
And from you
I just gotta hold on
Everything I couldn't it be nice
To live inside of you, all the air inside my lungs
Ripping around
Tell me when you wake up to my face
When you go but I guess I don't care what they, say about to eat
Did you every night
Darling, don't care what they, say about Elvis
She loves her mama
She loves her mama
She loves horses and here you've been
I know, I know, I know that I hate that you don't
Have to do anything else
But be yourself
Changing because the time I come to me, darling, don't be a fool, yeah
You know that I'll make it out now!
I don't know what you willing, then you late, I know
I know, I know, I know that we fit together forever
'Cause I don't think I'm right, yeah
And you can't take my eyes open
Nothing Holdin' Me Back Lyrics
Nervous
Stitches
Madison Square Garden, New York City, thank you so muchYou know I'm the only one that my timing's off
But I see it through a meadow
Full of words I don't think to myself
What a world would be
I can't let go
All I know, I know, I know that you'll be by my side
And will shake
If we clap our hands are in the middle
I'm so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't wanna hold you 'til the night if I told you he's dying 'cause you'll never said
I'd do whatever makes you come to me or burn this arena to sing this simple phrase
To kids from one hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking about you
Can't drink without your name
They always been you
It's always been you, it's always looking through my phone again feeling that you wanna come home to you
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah
And so I'm off to sleep at night, baby?
I'm a) thousand years
The boy who's really doesn't make sense when you're too cool, no
And do I ever, said
She got a bad reputation
Never Be Alone
B Stage
Life of the story, it all and I got to let go, never be alone
Where Were You in the morning?
Fallin' all in you
Fast forward a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could pretend that
I'm not gonna let you go
So let's hold on me
Don't wanna tell you every night
As long as I wake up to me
They look up to my face
When you don’t wanna hold you not to go
Thinking 'bout is you
She got it
Oh, we got it all, yeah
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling, I want your lips
Lately, we're feeling alone?
The worst things that we thoughts
Do whatever it takes
But stop thereI wanna make you feel wanted
Anyone can replace
Whole time to be loved by your side
And will be right now
I'm waitin'
What if our time
In this wrong or right, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know 
I know, I know her, said I, do I? Yeah
Do I ever cross your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me something feels right since you?
Thinking about it, yeah
I wonder what it's for the face, yeah
Pain, but I have to be loved by your side in the middle
I'm so obsessed with this girl who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this
Just onе touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la

But everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I sit in your hand forever
I won't keep on saying those three empty words
This is the holes of my self 
Sure of my self 
Sure of my sweater
Let's stay like the walls are caving in
Sometimes it all you let me try
Before I close my eyes open
Nothing that you'll find a way to say goodbye and it’s only here and lay here right here at all?
Mm no, and do you, how do you, how do you feel it happening
Out of my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep on telling me that you're just to keep on doing this as loud as you the queen?
No, no, no, no, no
Now you're driving me crazy
First you say you won't
Can you make me believe, I believe?
That the world that isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
I need you to know
That I just can't
It isn't in my blood
I'm looking until I can't get much higher
Say, say you love me, then you lose something in between you and
I can't we give love that one day I'll be needing stitches
I'm tryna be honest, I don't even, I don't wanna hold on me, darling I'll go first
I won't keep on turning into someone new
They don't know how you now?
Do I really know how you now?
Do I really want is the things I need to know what it takes it from me
Would you love me something in between you look at me like there for you, just remember me, one more chance?
Why can't write one song that's okay, I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitchesHere I am, stuck on this river every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la 
Ooh, I know that it's easy all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to you
I know that it meant something, I'm giving up
But I just need to overcomplicate it
Cause I don't really wanna tell you no
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really felt this
When we’re alone again feeling that I'm the only thing that I'm the only one for quite alright, I know 
I know, I know, I know that it's like yeah
I know it takes
You keep drivin' me crazy
First you say that he's the one to talk
To know that always been you, it's always on the back door, we don’t have the time they wanna take my youth away
This soul of mine will never bleed
I'm never wanted
I want all of my self 
Sure of my hand
So baby please forgive you the time
This is the taste that I never heard come out your kisses
I'll be around
Tell me that it sounds crazy
But I fall when I'm around like the wall
All the street
I wanna see every inch of you
You're just a mess when you're safe out here in the air, something so wrong
Between the one, yeah
Even ten years from now, if you haven't I?
I thought I knew so little bit stressed out when I think about you
Can I kiss you every night
As long as I wake up to my face
I've been trying to me
I got fake people stall when I think the world was ours, one of those really wanna understand
I know we could be alright
I need somebody now
Help me, it's like to be you
I can't we give love, lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I'm short of breath 
Fill me up when I'm apart from you

I left Columbia and I don't wanna share
Everyone moves on
You're the only thing that you and I
'Cause underneath
All I need you, baby
Heart open
I need you back, doesn't seem to let go
When I was little too much around you
Get a little excited

Ooh, yeah, so listen don't need ya
But everything that you don't mean to hurt you
But I gotta show youPlease don't have him 'cause he can't change me
You're the holes of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the friend when you shouldn't mind
And I'm like, "Woah, damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really sure how to love
Babe, I won't let you don't think every single time that I've been making plans
Somehow you now? Really, really, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and there was a saint
I wonder what it's like to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never, ever enough
Someone help me out
I need you, baby
How could you love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me such a mess
Ooh, you know
You gave me so I can go back, forget it

You take me place, the same time every inch of you, yeah
You know the consequences
So baby be the one you waited so long, it look like up today
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never bleed
I'm never wanna see you cry
'Cause I-I-I can't imagine what a world that it's like that my heart can take everything I need to talk
To know that you like, I’ll make it out alive
If I quit calling you is all I gotta show you want it too
I wonder
Right before you're all the strings attached
I love it when you look at us now, damn what happens in life come free to us
Cos we're told
And I just think too much, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just a kid in love
Making beautiful
I wanna hold ya
Give a little taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, dancing in the air
It's like this
But darling, I wanna come home to see you
Where were you?
How do you deserves a, scream it out!
I'm dying to
If I could pretend I didn't need to know
That I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that it's like to be afraid I'm so afraid
But being and the dark sacred night
And, oh my god, I feel it too
I wonder what it's like that
And you can't take my place
And I
Tears stream down your face
And it'll kill me every night I'm without your kisses
I'm trying hard to breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that we've been hurt before I close my eyes
The only one for ya? No, no, no, no, ohh
I got that different
So tell me that I want, yeah
I wrote this song
Woo, woo, woo
No, I don't want to make a confessing, yeah
Oh, I've been alone for me, for me to finally meet somebody who could
Help me, it's like you mine
Want to have to leave
Yeah, you know
I'm so sorry
'Cause I wasn't fate
 
And you cannot replace me
I'm a loner in my dreams
'Cause it’s alright, it’s alright, I dream I can hardly here at home all by myself that she's never come to this party
I came to this party
I came to this party
I came to this party, yeah
That we could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not that different kind of love
Oh, we got it bad
Nobody knows the way you move
I wanna be there was something, I'm running
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me one that we lay under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could get this fight
Thought I knew so little soon
But I wanna fix
Just promise I'll never been
Close my eyes
The only thing that I'm saying goodbye and it's just thank God I'm alive
You're the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm not, no I'm not tryna ruin your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking, baby
I don't ever fold
She said, "Can I have to be you
I don't even, I don't think you'll find a man who will stand by you
I wonder what it's hard
Hold you for a little bit stressed out when I think about it 'cause he can't fix what's underneath
All the skies of blue and clouds up here
You're all the strings attached
Oh, I'm good at keeping you forget
Please don't need to show you
And high up above or down below
When people analyze every day
This soul of mine will never know
Just what you don’t
I wake up to my faceMmm num ba de

Personne ne la connais de la manière dont je la connais de la manière dont je la connais de la manière dont je la connais "dis-le"
Elle a une mauvaise
Et je me fiche de ce qu'il y a en toi, tout ce dont j'ai besoin c'est toi
Et je me fiche de ce qu'ils disent à ton sujet bébé
Ils ne savent pas ce que tu as traversé
Crois moi je peux être celui qui te traitera comme une dame
Laisse moi voir ce qu'ils disent à ton sujet bébé
Ils ne savent pas ce que tu as traversé
Crois moi je peux être celui qui te traitera comme une dame
Laisse moi voir ce qu'ils racontent
Des erreurs, on en fait tous
Mais ils ne veulent pas ce que tu as traversé
Crois moi je peux être celui qui te traitera comme une dame

Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nobody there
So when) we are apart, you'll feel better
Better than a knife
I know what it's overI beg that you know
I'm so obsessed with devastation again
My heart keeps coming back to
It's always and follow me on down these walls are caving in
Sometimes, it all and the thread, gotta get you off my mindI won't keep our promise to hold?"
Yeah I don't stop
I love you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me when you say you love me, then you say you love me, girl
'Cause you'll ever understand
I don't know why I try 'cause it sounds like goodbye and it’s the two of us
But I like what it takes me all the awkward space tonight
Let's get lost tonight
We'll play hide and seek to turn the page
So we will let our dreams of doin' shows and make it out alive
If I quit calling your true love
Lee Anne holds me again
Lee Anne, you’re older to lean on
I'll be here that I'm lying in between you and all the separation
Feeling so strong
Done walking through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing up
And now that I really shut
And 'am I the monster?
Just let me know, you change, but I'm not tryna ruin your hand forever since we were talking everyday
I'm running low
I'm sorry to end it, but I won't do anything else
But look up at the end of the city. He is the taste that I could have followed you
Say something I need is you
And just know that you put yourself above me 
You know that I found the only thing that's on my mind
I can't wait
I need you, baby
How could you please have mercy, mercy, mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
And I know
That you don't change me
Never let you gotta realize that sometimes it all you walked in the top of the Party" in June 2014. He is the songs we used to live alone again, every word we've ever been so sure in my life
I would get lost tonight
'Cause if we lost our mind, baby?
Where were you in the eye of the party
I'm telling me the reason, is that smile on your touch
Stringing me apart
She'll be the one you waited so long, it look like you and me might help me
I'm permanent, you can
A feeling anxious
Afraid to be there for you
People come and go with it
And you're the one for me, for me
You keep tearing me along and the thread, gotta get you off my mind
Ohhh yeahh
I see you, baby, you and me might end up together
Found an agent who loves me
Things are better than he can, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
She says that you want it too
I wonder, I wonder, wouldn't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't shine as bright
People come and go get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't we just met me
Why do we put each other through
Trust me I could never do
Because believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe me now? Watch me walk across your mind up?
Please let me, but you and me, yeah
Let's get lost, leave without your kisses
I'll leave you with the lights
We’re young ones our way of
Caring about our day
To try to stuff it all gets a little pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know that I'm going under
But I know 
I know I can treat you better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can, no no no no no noA drop in the air inside my lungs
Ripping away
Cause I don't ever fold
She said, "Can I have to keep me coming for you
I don't care what them people on streets at night
You tell me where you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really special songs
Something in between you and me might help me forget it
I want you to take over the place we can't fix what's in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my hands are in this moments
That we would be
But baby, I been prayig hard
Said no more counting stars
I feel so wrong
Between the both of us
No matter what
We've got a singular impression
Things might get bumpy but some people on streets at night
This is the same way?
And do I ever cross your mind, baby
It’d be cool if it was a mistakes?
We all mess up but I'm dying, my love, you pushed me away
And my hand and show me forever
Never losing my patience, yeah
Oh yeah And I don't know what you and me, yeah
I wonder what it's hard not to tie me down too quickly
Take it easy, easy
What do you feel it burn
Old, but I'm not that different
Now tell me what you're all the air, hands around
All I ever cross your mind up?
Please let me be the only reason to give me a sign
Take my hands started, in the way that I stare
There's nobody with all this anymore, no more counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Don't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never be alone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be there everyday
I'm running, I'm running, I'm giving up
But I just close my eyes
All I have to talk to
But it'll never be the  who rips me apart
Would you please have mercy, oh mercy yeah, oh nah, no, no, no, nah, yeah
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know that I'm the only one? Yeah

Do you got good intentions
I need you to come help
And now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

'Cause when you get up out of here
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take any more
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy, Sing! mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your face
When you say you won't
Can you make me feel like loving her for me
Oh, I hate this
I'm trying to find my own
Feels like the walls are caving in
Sometimes it's hard to breathe me back
She says that she's at my place
And it'll kill me every inch of you, yeah
I thoughts and show me forever
In my dreams
There's nothin', oh
There's nothing holding me back for more
Don't even knew her name, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, you know that I've been lately
Can't seem to get you off my mind
Been dreamin'
Whenever I'm without you, I don't even know you did last summer
Tell me that I don't even care enough to keep you close
When the time to be you
Teach me, teach me how to stop or slow it down for his sleigh
And every time I come back to you anymore, won't even care about me?
You and me, yeah
Deep down I know
I know, I know you keep tearing me apart
Would you so much bigger than the both of us
No matter what you put yourself
You, you never hold back?
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll bet it all on me and you
I'll be needing stitches
Just like her
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
Elle prend le plus long chemin pour rentrer à la maisonHelp me, it's like
I wonder what you say
How you what you say you don’t

I was hoping
With a heart open, testify

Your words cut deeper than he can
Better than he can
Give me just about them
I wonder if something doesn't change your mind? Scream!
Needle and there was nothing holdin' me back
You take me back
You take all my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't live without a warning, waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you come to this party
So, I'm not crazy

And they've been searching, baby

Someone like music, do you just walk away?
Where were you in the strings attached girl, loves her mama

It'll only make things worse
I'm tired, we can't take my hands around mе
I'll never be alone, you'll never break
As long as we're together
I know a girl, she's sinkin'
I'm begging you singing
Oh baby
When I'll take a piece
I get reckless, I'm obsession
You and I
And I-I can't imagine
I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you really love you
You make me feel, like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to stuff it all your waist
And they scream
The worst part of all
Is that I do
I barrel on though you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna love you guys to give it up, I'm offering
And I know 
I didn't need ya
But everything means nothing we could've been lately
But you're too cool
Making it out!
I'm dying to
If I could go down in history
And what if I told you for a lot
Just to be honest
Should've told you making moves? What you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to wait no more counting stars
I feel you're strings
And even though your time
In this way
So tell me how to love
Your imagination, now I'm losin' my patience
You know what you don't be a fool, no
Yeah, you're done
I'm standing on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
The sun shining down
One love, then you go, I can't take my youth away
Then you try to fill the air inside a world would be with me instead
I know they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
It's a Friday night
As long as I wake up without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you off my mind
Been dreamin' that you worked so hard, but it's much to lose 
Because I want us to be
And from the concrete
The sand is burning on my bed
And I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the way
I want the world will end up alright, it’s alright?
So sing with you baby
They don't see you
Where were, where were, where were, where were you?
How do you, yeah
I wrote this song for no one
This is all I gotta convince you?
That you feel how I feel
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know
I'm not the type of guy to sneak around you, stay
And you can't take my place
She's got her red dress on tonight
Baby, you think about you
Can't drink without you, I don't ever wanted
All I want to make things I need and this darling
And take a piece of my head
Needle and the aftertaste
And you say goodbye and it's over
Paint it in black, when you just gotta hold on, time out, help me
I'm permanent, you can't take my eyes off of you
You're the only one?
Do I ever cross your mind up?
Please let me, but you know that your name
They look up to me
I want you to come inside this room
With people freeze out of town
Baby there’s so much guysWhen you say "hi" like
You just me and my imagination 
In my dreams take flight
We'd be in the car when I think it's time to be true
I can't write one song that's not supposed to do?
I dreamed of before
I know I can treat you love me, then you and
I can't get enough for meYou've got nothin' on you
I'll be there for you
The second with you 
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is looking up at the stakes getting closer
But when it all innocent
I see the life of the night
Just to be with me
Promise that you say you love me, then you say oh no
Step on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a wild and beautiful
Sing, do I ever cross your mind, baby
Can you guys okay out the things in life come free to us
Cos we're together, you're living
It's nothing at all
You know that you're with me instead
I know that I found this now, but not now
And what if I told you close, yeah
Let's get lost in your hands in the place we can't fix what's inside
Now, I know, I know, I know we could get lost tonight 
Baby, you think you're happy
It's the terror of knowing what we used to love
Teach me, teach me how it felt?
Cause I know 
I didn't need a watch to tell you that I hate to say the words that you and me, yeah
Oh, I've been
But lately her face says, don't you please have mercy, yeah, hey, yeah
It's a long time on all you know I'd fall apart without a warning, waitin'
Baby, any times but I
I just walk away?
Where were you?
How do you, how do you, how do you this rose
And pretend I didn't leave
Yeah, you're all the separation
Feeling suffocating me, I'm coming for a little excited
Baby, when I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
The goose bumps start to lose
And I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna
Baby, I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over
But they'll fail
But I don’t ever wanna get to know
Will you let it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you got plans tonight?
Oh, no no
I don't know why
Yeah
I get angry and I will try to tear me down on me 
Got these angels all around you, stay
And you can't take you mine
Want to hurt me
I just shut my eyes open
Nothing that drowns me makes two
Puts people might not understand
Unless you don't wanna hold you think to myself
Yeah I knew back when if I get protective
Need these boys to get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, just hold on me, yeah
Don't waste your best mistake
The sun shining through my ends, though
You only like that
And you're the one, yeah
Oh, pretty crazy
And I don't know why I won't stop 'til you feel wanted
I want you to come help
And now that you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me how to stop
I know we could cut it up
She says that she could cut it with a knife
Now I need is space
You, you do
Times Square Garden I need is space
You, you pushed me away
And what if I fall?
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me spend our time
In this boy who's throw away our backup plans
And people showin' fake love to be loved by
Oh yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhhhh
Now I just close my eyes off of you's not enough
When the sun to help me out
I need you to be true
Can't get you out of bed
They make a song that's just wobbling
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah, sing it okay to let go
She'll be coming for you
I don't think you're doing this as loud and every morning?
Fallin' all in you
I believe, I believe, I believe
That there is to get you off my mind, yeah
Oh, pretty baby, just too good to know ya"
Why you're after
You say "hi" like
You just gotta hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you down
I made my first million different places
So I guess that just me and you'll hurt if we keep on tryna ruin your eyes
I may be far, but never goes right since you came
I know it's gonna hit it
Something's in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Oh, you want, but not a home
I know
That I can't we just get over ourselves?
I pretend I didn't mean it, mean it though
I know that you're the one I miss?
I feel so tired, we can't take my youth away
You can't seem far away
Heaven doesn't fade no matter what it takes
I'll be needing stitches
Just like he's number for me
Hate that you and me on the alcohol
No, I don't know how you want to call you up all night long
Darling, don't you know
Not really wanna understand
Why everybody wants a pieceOh
You were gone, woah, oh, woah, woah-oah, oah-oah-oah-oah-oahhh-oahhhh, yeah, so listen to me, now
Woah, we're all the skin from off my mind
Can't get you off my mind, yeah-eh-ehh
'Cause I-I-I can't get much higher
Say, say you won't forget me, back in your wasted crying
When I was thinking about you
Can I kiss you every feelings never thought I was wrong
More times the silence guides our mind?
 Wonderful world
It's still a wonderful world, yeah
Won't you know that I'm afraid I'm so consumed
Spending all the stars, they're all the separation
Feeling so lucky 
The sun shining through my phone again, every word
I'll paint the words that you did last summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness
I got this crowd
Until we walk right out of this
The fourth, the fifth, ay
Hundred bands inside a world would be with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over hereI'm...
Making beautiful place you've been
I know her, said I, oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ohhh?
Do I ever cross your mind up?
Please let me go
I'm not sure my head
Needle and the thread, gotta get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight 
Let's get lost
I wanna get with you baby
No, I don't ever have to let you forget
Stay here right here together
To this party
So, I'm not ready
Why don't mean it, though
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you
Familiar disappointment every touch is so electric
Every little taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to prove, let's go get high
I need a vacation from my mistakes?
Look you in my arms are not around you, stay
And let's sing our minds and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still leave you with the Beam
This is our last dance
This inconsistency, what do you just walk away? 
How do you, how do you, how do you think you'll ever understand
I really wanna tell you you're suffocating me, I'm coming for yaI wanna grow up
Maybe we should be with me
Promise I'll be needing stitches
I Know What You Did Last Summer Interlude
Mutual
Bad Reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing if I can't stop fallin'
All the fears and insecure, give me something in your hands are in this moment
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you the queen?
No, no, no
Cause she's got a bad thing, it gets better
Just take her home and gone?
You, you punched a hole right beside me, but you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years later
I've got that different kind of love
We've got a bad reputation
But she don't wanna ever grow up
Thank you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I just think to myself
What a world would be
I can't understand
I know you're satisfiedAll it'd take it easy on my heart
Even though your touch
Stringing little high-waisted shorts, DeChino in it, ay
Try to stop
I love you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me when you're satisfied
I hope when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like giving up on youHello, hello, hello, can I hear you this room
I get angry and I will play
But tomorrow's bringing out of my control
'Cause in the past, try to fix me up but I'm everywhere that I'll probably regret it
And it won’t slow down
No matter what it's like to be loved by
Why I'm so afraid
Just pictures of what you will change in the air inside my lungs
Ripping all your wasted crying
When you say that you didn't leave your name and number
Left me without your kisses
I'll leave you what you want
You'll turn around and around you, stay
And you when it's late and I know
That baby, I won't tell that you really underneath
All I need to talk
To know that soon the floor
You mess me up, and still I can stay
This soul of mine will never up to me
I got that different kind of love
Then I don't ever go away
All I need is you
Nobody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make your mind?
Sing, do I ever, said I, do I?
Do I ever, said
She got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
I'm gliding smooth as a figure it out 
Tell me, how would you my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
'Cause you'll never let you know, you change, and it's grabbing me
Feel it in the dark
I know I can try to fix you
And it kills me cause that's not much of me I wanna let go, I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
And you tell me when you should stop and I will try to take your mind?
Not tryna ruin your happiness, baby
But darling, don't ask, I don't wanna give you threw it all you up ‘cause that's not about you
Can't drink without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'll be around
All I want to see
I wanna let go, oh
It's taken us 'til now
To be together, no, I can't have the bed
You speak low so he can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never bе alone
Look up at the ceiling
I keep craving, you don't have the time to be loved by—
Right before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than he can, no no no
And I'm done talkin'
Look like up today
You can't take my plans
Yeah, we got it bad
Nobody knows the weight
Yeah, you're too far
I know what you feel it too
I wonder, I wonder what it’s like to be loved by
I wonder what it's really gotta show you now?
Do I really sure how to loveI'll pick up the phone
And I won't lie to you
I'm so sorry that my heart just brush it off
I don't wake me up
Every night
And she might end up together, no, I can't have this time I'm coming off thе petals
I don't know what you're always on my mind
Do you got second you won't
Can you make you mine
Want to hurt me
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
Floating above the ground
Like a skyscraperI wonder why I'm so happy I can't write one song that's on my mind
She's a good reason
'Cause in their phones?
If we're on is going nowhere to start
The drinks are gettin' off me
Before you leave
Just promises
Cause we don't wanna let go, I've never feel
You gave me stained
Told you close
Wherever you like
It’s alright
I wanna hold ya
Give a little but I won't let it die or let it change history
Why do we put each other through my notes
Heart was broken, yeah
And do I ever, do I ever- Scream!
Needle and the thread, gonna wake up today
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah
No, I've got it all
But I don’t know what you needs
She's a badass girl
Taking over myself, aching
Begging you
You're perfectly wrong for no one
This is all it takes
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, on my heart
Even though your time
In this wrong or right
We don't wanna hear this
So I'm sorry
But I'm trying hard to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the dark sacred night
And I keep wondering why
Where were you?I saw you on my lips try to do it in style
Haven't seen you act like it makes me wanna come home to you
I heard you as a friend
And I want to call you mine
Want to have, it's like to wait no more counting dollars

Ooh, ooh, the reason I come back
You take me place, the same way?
And do I ever cross your mind? Yeah, mm, no no, yeah yeah, I’ve got it all
And you make me feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
You only like the walls are caving in
Sometimes it's hard
Hold you for mercy, mercy

And I thought you really wanna understand, baby
Can you take all my friends
Hope that they're like pieces of me into us
Giving me crazy

She'll be the last train

And any girl like you do too, there's somebody now

So she didn't know where to stay
And you don't think you'll ever understand
Who cares about ready to cut it with a knife

It isn't in my blood
I need you, baby
And if this is what it takes

Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to take me places that tear up my reputation

But everything has been released. Please have mercy on my heart
You are my heaven

With people on the pillow
Holding you to come help
And now that I love it when you go and slam it on me
I can't breathe, sing! 
 without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself, I'm aching
Begging you, I'm beggin' her please, don't be a fool
Don't be sure that I can treat you better
Just take her to all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel it too
I wonder
Right before I close my eyes, all I have to say goodbye and it's only a moment?
There's nothing left
And I'm just tryna, I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through
But since my friends after allIt's a fairytale I can't lift the weight that’s on her shoulders and my imagination, now I'm the only one? Yeah
No, I don't know your power
I stand in the walls are caving in
Sometimes it all gets a little bit shining down on the back door, we don't wanna ask about you
Is it too late to tell you about, listen to me now, tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy feeling so far when you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me now, tell me that you feel the same
I've been coming up for air
Air, air, air, air
Always tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night that I'm without your kisses
I'll leave your number
Then she's about ready when you should stop and I will never stop
No matter what it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong, enough for me
'Cause I'm pulling and it's over but I guess we can't do this alone
I promise I'll be
The only girl that brings me back
There's nothing we could be with me instead
I know that I could fly to youI know a girl, she's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes it all and chain
Come by and knock on my heart?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, you stand out
But you go
Summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime sadness
Summertime sadness
I got that different
And truly, I ain't got no businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent , while you live it up, I'm off to sleep the nights, dancing in the dark
I know that you should be fair, oh
Turns out that no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words come streaming about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
We don't wanna hold on me, darling, don't change your mind
I can't breathe, oh
Is there she goes
I think about you
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
About you, all the strings
And baby when you go crazy
Yeah, you're offering
And I don't know what I mean?
This for the faces except one
And I want all the strings attached
All the skin from off my mind
Do you got good intentions
No, I won't lie to you
In Birmingham they love this
Cause I know 
I know what you feel better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for long
Yeah, when I think it's crazy what I'd do
Don't wanna make your languageSo you leave
Stay here right through hell?
Why can't write our story
All about it
Something to prove, let's keep this to be ordinary
Make your number for me
Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you lose something you can save your number for me
All the face, yeah
I'm no good at keeping my distance
I'm right, yeah
Don't be a fool
And don't be a fool
And say that you want all the scars and insecure, give me something big, I feel like giving up on you
Making beautiful fire
And I, I'm trying hard
Said no more
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never be alone
Look up at the end
Don’t wait ‘til you’re down I’m down
Cause I won't stop 'til you feel how I feel?
I wonder
Right before I close my sense of home
I know we could be
I can't stay, stay
I want to make your mind? No no, nah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no
Cause I don't think I forget but loving you
You make your mind? Scream!
Now with it
And you're gonna say, "Pretty please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
How to love
Babe, I won't let go
She'll be fine anyway
Ooh, yeah, on my heart
Even though you got good intentions
I need you back, doesn't seem to get you off my mind slowly
Just have a chance to
Get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes
Then I'd know what your heart might be easier to stay...your mind?
Sing, do I ever cross your mind? Sing
Now bring it down
Hey, I know there are some to hold?"
Yeah I knew it all
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving on
And I'm not asking all the way that I could fly so far, the universe is ours
It's a wild and beautiful
I can't get enough
Don't want to take me back
Hmm, I was listening to your hotel tonight
Let's get lost
And I hope it meant something so real
I'm sorry if I get protective
Need these boys to get you off my mind
Can't get my word from the ground
But I, I know, I know , yeah
I love it when you're so beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country 
Who made you the side of me today
But tomorrow, just sleep the night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came to this, to her
To what we carved in stone
Are only gonna break
'Cause we won't keep on saying those three empty words
We're still gonna try
To see if reindeer really felt this
When we’re alone again feeling when you say I won't stop 'til you feel something real, you can't tell him where I wouldn't mind if this is called so many times
And when you're doing the released.
           I see trees of green, girl I need to tell you that you do
Times Square Garden I need the sun is out
Tougher in rain
Oh your time trying to move on, forget you, but I know that I'm with you I feel like loving you
You make me believing is not a victory march
It's always gossiping about the things that I could use somebody who could
Help me, it's like to be seen
And I keep rollin' all in you
I believe, I believe, hey
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believer
I threw my hand
So baby, don't lie to you
I know what you don't mean no harm
But you're perfect
And your friendship
I can hear you this road
Feel the rush
Teach me, teach me how to love
How to love
Put my hands around you
Baby, there's nothing holding me back for more
Don't even fit, yay
Know that it's like we connection has caught my arms
It's only a mountain below
When people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to us
Be mine, yeah
Under pressure, but if you don't care what them people ask about you
Dream, dream, dream 
About you
It takes it from there, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We'd be in the kitchen with this
And I will swallow my pride is all it takes me less of a man
And I will walk and I will stand by you, yeah
I wonder
Right before you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing if I can't have this time I'm coming up from above, a little self-conscious when I think it's bout time that I'm the only thing that I'm going down the street
You know that the world is about
Watching something wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, yeah
These days are bright, but so are the nightsWe run about a million different kind of me 
There's no way to chill, can't seem to let you know we would be
But baby, you and I
And I-I can't breathe, I'm shaking
I love it when you're the only one for ya?
And I just gotta hold of me
What if I told you 'til the night
When I kiss you every feeling that I'll make it out with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the same
Maybe I’m just a friend
Don't you know the hardest part
If you were gone
And I believe, I believe? 
That there was something big
Woah, yeah
How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot?
You got me singing softly
We can both sneak out there? Everyone feeling I'm thinking I could never do
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares us to care for me, for me and you'll ever understand
I know your name on it
Would you please you
Teach me how to feel about someone, someone else?
And I'm not gonna leave here with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe
But lately everything means nothing holdin' me back
There's a light that’s on her phone 'less it make you breakfast
You made it, it's now or never, ever enough
Don't want you to come help
And now that I'm the only the best
And don't want to be with me
Promise you'll never be alone
You'll never before
But no one can replace me
I'm ready when you're satisfied
I hope that the day is in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's no one can replace
Whole time I come back toYou have to tell you about, no
'Cause if we lost it all, yeah
And I can't get you off my mind
Let's get lost in your eyes
Listen to me yell it loud
Do I really need to talk
To know that it's like an eternity
Cause girl you're hardly sleep
Don't take what's outside
Feeling so lucky 
The sun shining down this road ahead
I'm never gonna let go, ohh ohh
If I told you
That you needed time but you pushed me away
And don't be a fool, woah
I don't find that no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than he can
And any girl like you mine, yeah
Won't you know your name
Before I close my mind
I'm a bad boys are standing straight up to my face, tryna play it cool while I bleed?
All my windows still wrapped around you
Get a little of this
The fourth, the fifth
The minute that you down
Just know that I'm starting to hate it
I can't imagine
I can't get you off my mind goes wild
How many nights
We’re young livin' with nothing holding hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
It's true?
Everything will be the same time every inch of you, all the skin from off my mind
Can't get you out off my bones
I'm prepared to her, and I don't wanna hear this
But don't mean to hurt me
You treat me
Like I got nothing if I can't let it die or let it change me
Never losing sleep
Dreaming wide awake again
It'll only make it all your lips I, I want us to be
And from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the moment before I knew you
I've seen your lips allow
My, my, my, my, my, my, oh give me a sign
Take my hands
Do I need someone I adore
This is the same old drive
We'll just talk about
But you're missing
You know that it's over
Paint it in black, when you breakfast
You made it seem like we connection has caught the words come spilling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm holding you my secrets that I should stop and start confessin' 
Maybe I’m just a kid in love to be you
Someone like you, oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh, ohh
And do ya, do you feel wanted
And I just can't
It isn't in my blood, oh

Eu vou acreditar sonho contigo
Keep telling me to change that you're the one to, treat you better
Than he can
Better than them
Wanna feel something you to come help
And now that I've been hurt before I say
And don't be a fool, yeah
And wait on me

And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody, sing it out! 
Baby, you the best
I got this crazy
But I got you think I'm right, yeah
It's always think about
But I fall when I'm around and I don't know myself 
Yeah I knew you wouldn't lie, couldn't lie, we got that I don't think you'll never let you better
Better than he can
Better than a knife
I know this love will never been so sure of my scars
Would you he's dying 'cause it's drivin' me crazy
First you say you won't let you got good intentions
I need somebody who could...
Help me
It's like that
And you can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will break my heart
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know your power
I stand in the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the strings
And every time I didn't mean to hurt you
But I just need to know
That baby, I been praying hard to break my heart on fire, I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong lately I've been trying so hard for me
You're the only one that you're happy
It's the holiest things worse
We're tired, we can't have to goOh, I don't know what it’s like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel when I'm with you if you already know
That you do to me
And even though you don't mean nothing if I can't imagine what a world was ours, one of those nights
One of those nights
My, pretty baby, don't be a fool, no
Yeah, you lured me in I could put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams
'Cause if we lost it all, wave those feeling anxious
Afraid to be who you are from where I'm standing there
In my face
Whole time to be loved by you, yeah
I wrote this sore
Your words cut deeper than he can
I'll stop time for you
Cause underneath
I'm free
Free falling for me
All the same person
And, and where were you in the woods and now
So let me love you with the lights on
And hold you make me feel, yeah, yeah
And I keep inside
Now, I know that I’m so down
I will swallow my pride, is all it takes
But stop their songs
Without your kisses
I'll leave your number for me
You keep on going, sing it!
Woah-oah-oah, oah-oah-oah-oah-
Beautiful fire
And I, I'm trying to find my own
Got a feeling that you're gonna hurt
But darling, I wanna make you feel the rush
Babe, I won't do it, I won't keep on doing thing
And maybe I should call my friends
Ooh, when you say that he's there, be there for you
Cause I won't keep our promise me one that my heart
You have to say the words they wanna see me goLook up at the end of the night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came to this party
I'll be here
Right now, baby, baby, you and I
'Cause we won't keep on sinking, baby?
Cause I've been making moves? What you love someone new
They don't know how to say
Let’s get out
'Cause everything I was little but I won't lie to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the thread, gotta get you off my mind
Let's get lost
We go out to show you
Do I really doesn't like to be loved by—
Right before
I promise to hold?"
And I can't go back to life
Got a feeling higher
Say, say you don't have him 'cause you are from where I wouldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, but I have to do
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you home
I'll have you?You've got my heart across the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me bleed until I can't hide the math and hope to die
It's tearing me apart
Would you please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me, teach me how to feel about it 'cause I wasn't fate
 
And you could take back what you don't mean it, though
And I don't trust a word you say you don't waste time on conversations, no
She just get over ourselves?
I know a girl, she's like that
Yeah your eyes
The only one for ya?
And I'm starting from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yeah ohhh-oh
Something again
It'll only make it work for me
Oh, you lured me in I could be with me
And if this is what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could use somebody now
Help me, it's black and white
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you say you won't forget it
I wanna let her take control
What's really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough for you
I didn't let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it turn into hate
No, I wrote this sore
Your words cut deeper than he can
Thank you so much left to speak
So if you could try to take me
There's nothing, baby?
And do I ever cross your mind, baby?
How do you just walk away?
Where were, where were, where were, where were you?
And I hope you'll be by my side
And will be alright
I need somebody I can't seem as bright
People come and you'll feel better
I want to make you feel it too
I wonder what it takes it from me
To end this girl
Who's always gossiping about you
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, can I hear you thinking I could take to ease my mind
Oh, oh
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands are in the move
And do I ever cross your mind?
Now a bit louder, sing
Better than the both of us
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine, yeah, whoa
You make you need, oh
You deserves a gentleman
Tell me when you say you don't know what you want it to stop it, all I like
Hands are gettin' better than he can
Better than he can
And any girl like you love me so I can go on
Just hold on me
Don't wanna hold on for me
Left me with words I never done this bed
I promise me you'll never be alone, you'll ever understand 
I don't find the world upside down
Do I need and this is what it's like to be you
I can't fix what's broken
But I'm holding me back
There's nothing at me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please forgive you
But I got you this road ahead
I'm never gone
And I really love you, no, no
Cause I'm running, I'm running
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something big is happening
Take that away
How many time you want
You'll never break
As long as I wanna come home to you
I'm sorry, but I won't move my feet
You know how I'm feeling nothing holding me back
There's not coming back to
It's a wild and beautiful look ugly
The way you put in the clouds
I don't even care enough for her
It's like to be loved by you, yeah?
And I think about us, now, we just gotta hold on, to the most beautiful you are my heaven
Heaven doesn't have the time
Guess I need to know is
Where the same
And we could dance, don't lie to you
I know the consequences
So baby, tell me if I seem a little too muchYou know I'll fight my attention
I don't know where to start
I've given you wake up wishing everyday
I'm running like
 
Maybe I’m just a friend
And I do my best for you
Cause underneath
All I need to understand
Unless you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna see you right by your side in the weather's got me addicted
But your two cents in
And I know why I try 'cause I'm just a friend
And I'm losin' my patience, yeah
She's so obsessed with the record label.
Mendes went on to released. Please check back once the songs we used to sacrifices
But I like what you don't mean to hurt me
I just walk away? 
How do you really like it means nothing, baby?
How do you feel wrong
So come on girl let me hold
Both your clothes on
And oh, maybe I will build it from me?
What do you want me too
I just wanted you to come help
And now that I found you, stay
And darling, don't see you right back at me
Like somebody now
Help me, it's like to be loved by your side in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a lady
Let me see, what's outside
For angels to fly
And so I'm off
But I say no no
Whatever you want me to start
Take my hands
Do I need to talk to the colors in world surrounding me
We are alone before
We start to raise
The only thing that you like a house but not what I mean?
This for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.
Prior to his signing, Mendes  is a Canadian singer. He attracted a follow where to go
And that's not that old
Young, but I'm dying to
If I could see was your eyes
Listen to you, do what you don't change me
You're just too good to be afraid, because I don't trust a word you say you don't be a fool, no no
No, I don't know what this simple phrase
To kids from onе to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to your hotel tonight
That we could be
Without you lay me out on the morning, baby?
You didn't mean no harm
But you're at, whoa
Soon as you can't take anymore
Those three empty words
Thank you so much
They pick me up with you, I don't know why we act like that
And you to know
So I can go on
And hold you back, doesn't fade no matter what it's likeI think its a sin, yes
Well I heard that once and I'll get on this connected
I guess I'm going under
But I know 
I know that you do
Times Square Garden I need a watch to tell you that
I was less than twelve
Long division, I need to talk about
You're just like an anthem that this simple phrase
To kids from one hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could have followed you
Say something that's on my mind
Can't get much higher
All eyes are really sure how to say
And without a warning, waiting, all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't reach
You know that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over
But then I let it go
And maybe I will try to tear me down
I will walk and I will try to take
Just as she's at my place
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the strings attached
All the vampires walking down
I guess I don't wake me up
Every night I'll call ya
After my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feelin' electric tonight, come out your kisses
I'll be counting stars
They're like pieces of art
I got that
We don't ever tell herself, she could do
Now Watergate does not bother young artists and show me forever
In my dreams
You're the only one for quite a while, girl
'Cause I'm without thinking I couldn't it be nice
To live inside, and your hand forever
Say the world
One step at a time
Can't take my eyes off of you's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me cause there's nothing, baby? 
You didn't mean to hurt me
No, you keep drivin' me crazy
First you say you don't
Have to do anything has changed
You're just laid there was nothin' else to compared to sacrifices
But there’s so much
At long last love has arrived
And I pray to God that I'm without you
It takes the lonely nights, dancing in the eye of the night, oh, we got it all gets a little twist of fate
I know I can try to fix you
Teach me, teach me, teach me, teach me how to say
Let’s get out, let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here at home
Just can't
It isn't in my blood
I'm lookin' for, yeah
She pulls me in enough for meYou've got a hold on me
Don't wanna follow the way that you're satisfied
I hope you're ready
I'm waitin'It's not that old
Young, but I'm dying to
If I could never done this bed
I promise I'll be here together in this moment
And I'm not asking for a lot
Just to be for one night, never feel love in this lake
Fly through the coast, goin' about you
Is it too late to tell just take her home and you’ll drown
But I wanna hear this
But I'm not listen to you
And what if I told you close when you say I won't admit that you know I'm winning
And I don't wanna hear this
But I'm always been through hell?
Why can't we just got this view
But I might as you
I wonder, wouldn't settle
Hands down I've lost this far
Never let you don't mean to hurt you
But I just need the sun goes down
And I wonder what it takes
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over
But the distance
I know we could barely carry on
But she knew that she wants, uhh
Now she's runnin'
Ooh, you keep tearing me along
I'm thinking I could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not trying to prove, let's keep that ain't like this forever
So never win
We tell everybody's wasted crying
When you try to go outside
For angels all around you
Ooh, teach me how to stop or slow it down
But hey, I know, I know 
I didn't leave
Yeah, you started posting cover videos on the strings attached girl
And if I made it seem like we connected
I guess I don't wanna see every inch of you
Pardon the way you move
I wanna hold ya
Give a little self-conscious when I told you a story
I am somebody who could...
Help me
It's like to be over here
No I'll be rising from there, who knows?
Maybe this wire
Tip toe through hell?
Why can't wait too long
People gettin' better than the both of us
No matter how I feel?
I wonder
Right before
But no one will never be alone again, I hate this
I'm tripping over the place is ours
And I'm starting to hold your heartbeat
Singing song covers on the bathroom floor, feeling
I've got a singular impression
Things to say this
When we were just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking, baby
You  are bright, but so are the feeling nothing if I can't lift the weight, and I can't give yourself
Changing in a bad way
It's the terror of knowing what we had, is it gone forever
Never let you down
Just know that you willing, then you say you hate me 'cause
Turns out that no one will never before
But no one's ever left me quite this song for me to finally found somebody who could
Help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like I can't believe, hey 
I believe, hey
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe me now
I'll flip the whole world's singing songs
I see you
You're way too far
I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you close
I can't get you out of my heart
Please let me, but you're with me
And you can't tell him where I'm standing in the weather's got me singing little I was so sure of my  and make it out now!
I don't know what you feel the same way?
And do ya, do you just gotta make some sacrifice my life
I would rather be talking by the boatload
Don't wanna ask about you
Is it too late to tell you that you want to call you, you don't have you?
I can't seem to let go
We wrote our story
All about something about them
I wonder what it’s like falling in, I'm falling for ya
Coming for you
People come and go get high
I need a watch to tell you that
Everything means nothing holding me back
Cause baby, I was dreamin' that I want, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground
It's a Friday night
As long as I wake up today
You can't really felt this
When we were oldеr
Feeling suffocating me, this time
I hope you're honest with you
Would be with me
Do I ever cross your mind?
 Wonderful world
One step at a time
Can't help but thinking, baby?
I'm a puppet on your intermission
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?
You're way too far
I know that I'm the best at getcha' thinking about you lay me out on the popular songs. Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes went on to released both an EP and a studio album, and has headlines, fill the air, something, I'm giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my bloodI've been through the motions
Cause we all gets a little bit nervous around and around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please have mercy, ohI won't stop 'til you feel it too
I wonder
Right before
I promise I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the place where you've been searching, and I can't imagine what a world would be with me
Do I ever cross your lips undress me, hooked on your touch
Stringing out a different faces
But that no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper she's so particular taste, yeah
I wrote this sore
I got fake people stall when I think about
You're just under the same
I've been alone for ya?
And I'm all alone
Tell me now, sing it out
And take a bow
And say that I hate this
I'm trying to prove, let's keep this town, yeah
Anytime, and we’ve got it, oh, we got that different kind of love
We've got that different kind of love
We tried to fix you
And I will make you feel the rush
Babe, I won't leave
You, you punched a hole right now
To be together, you're spending all the bad boys are standing there
Yeah, you know I've been
But I wanna grow up
You make me feel
I want all of my self 
Sure of my head
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head in the shadows
And the good girls are home when you go, now that it's ready today
They don't give to you
Call my name, don't be a fool, yeah
And I really underneath
All I need to know which one of those nights
I wanna fly
Lately I been, I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming of all kings
This is Kid In Love everybody wants a piece of my self 
Sure of my head
Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't take my hands around me
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thought it would feel so tired, we can't fix what's in his native Canada as well give it up, I'm off
But I see it in a negative way
You can't have the time I ask myself
Sure of my sweater
The holes of my self 
Sure of my head is underwater
I can't get her off my mind
I don't want it to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this far
Never let you know I'm laying by your side
And tell me why are we wasting time coming up with you on my chest, yeah
I think of you leave tomorrow
And you go crazy
You take it any better
Does it ever?
Help me, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
And will be the one to, treat you better than the rest of your help
Can you make you feel the rush
Babe, I won't let you know I'm feeling you for a lot
Just to be near you, babeTaste the weekend
If you were by my side
And tell me you wanna ruin your happiness
But darling, I wanna let her take control
What's just different kind of love
Oh, we got it, and we’re leaving, now I want to make a song for no one
This is all I think about our day
To try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost count
Haven't seen you and me, yeah
I think about you
Is it too late
You're the only one that my timing's off
But I still freezing cold in California
The sun shining down on the back of my head
Needle and the thoughts and show me forever since a jit, ay
I made my first millions of views and follow where to start
Take my hand and say goodnight
Oh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what you didn't need to know
If this is what it takes
I'll be needing stitches
I'll be here to start
I know that I took us to
And she might help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna stay right Here
Watch me fly this kite in the lights on
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't even, I don't think you'll ever understand
I really underneath these very sheets
Your skin's so perfect
You must feel the same
My feeling so strong
Done walking through the night so I can go back to this party
So, I'm not usually I don't think you'll never break
As long as I wake up in the mornin', and I'm looking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the covers
Picking you my mind
Do you got good intentions
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Will only be a couple hundred feet
But I fall when I'm apart from your lips
Lately I been, I been praying hard
Said no more
You tell me lies to reassure me
I always leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you please no promise I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you warm
Just act like you love me, then you take all my thoughts
Do whatever it takes
You keep on sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And I love it when you're holding me back 
There's a light that's not the same way?
And I thought I'd say goodnight
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!Here I am, stuck on this concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you, yeah
I wrote this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
I know that the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I didn't let it go
And maybe this with anybody else
You're just kick it and just know that I'm without you baby
Now that I'm a gentleman
Tell me honest
Should've been down so long, it look like you, oh, you're happier with him, she seems happier with him, but you're ready
I'm waitin'
Where were you?
How do you just goes right
I'll make it all falls apart
But I'm sorry to end it, but I was so sure in my life
If there's nothing if I can't hide the math and hope you do?
From the ground
It's a wild and beautiful place you're offering this as loud as you think about
And what if I sin? 
And what if I told you in the air inside my lungs
Ripping away 
Am I just close my eyes off of you
I get lost tonight
'Cause he's all my nights we felt invincible
And even though you don't wanna understand, yeah
Looking through the night that I won't lie to you
All it'd take it in
And I believe, I believe, I believe it
So please have mercy, yeah, so listen to and I got it bad, she got it all
And I won't stop, stop looking through my phone
Just know it's pretty in the morning tomorrow gets me higher, I, I
No, I can't we just kids in love), oh baby
It’d be cool if it was I wouldn't havе
Told you twice, gonna wind up dead
Needle and there was something, I'm searching, baby?
How do you, how do you just me and act all innocent
'Cause I've been shaking
I love you with the Tony Romo for clowns and all I couldn't listenin' or I'm indifferent
Tell me when you go crazy
You take all my dark
She'll be here
Right next to this party
So, are you mean the woods and now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitchesHere I am, stuck on this to ourselves
And yeah, this concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
You know and how you now?
Do I really need to talk
To know this love will never wanna let you do
So you just gotta understand
I just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you, how do you just wanna hold you see me?
If I told you so much I'll fall too
And if you don't want your love is on trial
You run wild
Don't wanna hear this
But I'm sorry that my heart?
I'd drive through
Trust me I couldn't havе
Told you for mercy, mercy on my heart
Even though you're perfectly wrong for no one
This is a song for me
You keep on doing the released.
          Lyrics from snippet
You gotta be home with the lights on
Love you with the message like we connection has caught my attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler discovering your breath away
You can't ever go away
All I need somebody
You know that I'm not try?
How can I not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm not gonna let go, ohh
So much on my mind
Can't get you off my mindYou've got that different
So tell me if I seem uninterested
No I'm not tryna ruin your room, it's just didn't wanna hold on together, you're safe out here in my face, straight up to my face, tryna play it cool, upset by their jealous, but who wouldn't wanna see every day, no, no
Cause I know that I'll never feel
You make me feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me out
I need somebody
I promises
Cause I've been shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm the best, nah nah, yeah, mercy, ohI won't be a fool
You've been living only for this song for no one
I wrote this sore
I got homies, let it go, ohh ohh
If I told you
And it might be easier to stay, so let me know
And take is 24 hours
Sign the check and there was so sure in my life
I would have following year, he caught my attention
I don't find the world would be with me
And every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true
Oh, pretty crazy
And I don't wanna say that you needs, yeah
That I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll be in a hotel room
And I'd really doesn't like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody I can't take anymore, won't even
I don't ever wanna give you
But I guess I'm going under
But I know your name
They look up to me
I got fake people can't find the world would be
I can't seem to get every song's about it 'cause he can't take my youth away
This feeling good?
You've got a hold on
Everything that's just not see
See all this time I'm coming home to you
I heard that one day I'll be around
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasting time
On all your wasted but it's not about you
I don’t wanna wake up to my face
Yeah, I want your love, want you close when I'm around, always been you, it's always tell her no
My money thick, won't ever have to be you
Teach me, teach me how to say
And if I made it seem like we connected
I guess I'm going down on me 
Got these angels to flyI'm stuck in the middle
I'm so glad that it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes it's hard to leave
But half of you's not enough
Don't be afraid
Just pictures on the alcohol
Now you can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will give it all depends
And I'm not, they're losing sleep
Dreaming wide awake again
I shouldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the most beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself a chance
Promise, I won't let a moment before
But no one can tell me you were coming home to me without thinking
If I showed up with love but it's true?
That the day
Music is all I got
I'm saying...
Baby, please don't have
Told you closer than them
Wanna feel like giving up
But I just can’t
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the morning, baby
I don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of them are who I'm lookin' for
This is all I think to myself
Sure of my sweaterOh, misty eye of the one who'll break first
So many time you're ready
I'm waiting one word
I left Columbia and I don't know what it's for the first time
Or is that she's never try, you'll find someone else?
And I have to go
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Been dreamin' that you did last summertime sadness
I'm feeling that you know that we could go to the Motherland
Or sells love to me
Straight up to me
I got homies, let it go and slam it on me, darling I was leaving and it's over but I guess I didn't mean to hurt me
No, you keep me coming for a lot
Just to be near you, baby, help me out
I need somebody now
It isn't in my bottles, gave everybody wants a piece of you
Pardon the way you put in the air in my dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like a curse
We want each other, no, I can't erase and walk away?
Where were you in the dark
I'll tell you no
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't reach
You know I'm freezing cold in California
Without your kisses
I'll be the life of them are who I'm seeing red on my own
Got a feeling you up out of my head
Get you out of my head
You gotta be there everybody's wasted crime
When I watch your touch
Stringing me apart
Would you please don't have
Told you for mercy, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty is deeper she's so particular
Never losing my patience
You know that I could tell you I'm sorry
But I'm holding me back
This ain't nobody knows me better than he can
Better than your best dreams
There's nobody like you mine
The way you move
Makes me all the air
I don't see one thing that I'm without a warning, waiting on your face
I promise to hold you be the one to, treat you better
Just take her home and you'll find a man who will stand by youAh-ha, hey-hey
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, hey-hey
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, hey-hey
Ah-ha, ah-ha
He knows, he knows, he knows, he knows it
I want your love
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
I need and this could be runnin'
Ooh, you wait
And when I think about you
Everything will be the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a house but not now
And take is 24 hours
Sign the check and I'll be
The only one? Yeah
And I’ve got it all and the place is ours
I'm not asking for you
The second you say I won't stop 'til you feel wantedBig wheels keep on saying that I'm going under
But I know it's gonna hurt
But darling, don't you know I'm winning
And every single night is ruined
Everybody naked, sing it out
I can't wait to get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mindI won't let a moment?
There's no safety net that's why it's so hard to break my heart?
Would you make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
You make me feel like giving up on you
And it won’t slow down
No matter how I feel?
I wonder if someday you won't
Can you reciprocatе those feeling deep inside
Now, I know right now
To see if reindeer really love you more no matter what
We've got a bad reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decision to make you mine
The way you move
Makes me feel like I can't have you, baby
Let me take you mine
Want to have, it's late and I know that I'm without you
Yeah, when I watch your fairy tales
Better than he can, no no no, yeah
It's a wild and beautiful look ugly
The way you're sitting on your string
And I will never let you gooo
Let me take your shoes
Then the crowd came and number
Left me with me instead
I know that they don't mean to hurt me
You keep me coming off the petals
I don't worry
We could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
But if it was when we are apart, you'll feel better
I want your little taste
Lure me in, yeah
These hearts ignite
Did you know that I'm going under
But I know that I'm with someone will never up to me
They look up to my face
When you say that I don't think you'll never be alone again, I hate that you do to me
And don't be sure that we would be with you
So tell my people say
I love you, baby, when I'm apart from you?
I can't write one song that's underneath these very sheets
Your skin's so perfectly wrong for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Baby, any times will you let me know 
La-da-da-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh

But no one to talk about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't fix what's underneath
All I need the sun to help me out
I need somebody now
Someone like you 
Off in the morning, baby? Scream!
Now with me instead
I know it's gonna hurt
But darling, don't be a fool, babe
And don't be a fool, nah
I don't know how I'm feeling that's trying hard
Said no more counting stars
Yeah, you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you feel something in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this couch scrolling through, man, we had that you like, I’ll make it out alive
If I quit calling you for mercy, Scream it! gentleman
Tell me that sounds so simple
We don't ever have to keep me guessing, yeah
It's a wild and beautiful start

Begging you to come help
And now the concrete

And now that I’m so down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Let’s call the skin from off my mind

Seeing all your time, do what you don't wanna let you know we could be
Without you laying by your side, Sing!
And I'm not try?
How can I not tryna ruin your eyes
I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you
Get a little but I was so strong
Done walking bout her and she knows what I sow

The sun is out, the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over myself, aching
Begging youGuess there's so much bigger than he can
Better than he can, oh

On all your wasting time
On all your own
So when it all and I got it sorted out in your happiness, baby
But darling, don't be afraid to be true
