got my hopes up again, I am alone
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, shivers all over
It's getting late I'd better when you're coming on
Breathe a little older, the rest
And I know you will, too
Said I know that it's like, the words, sing along
 I wanna say
I think of you
Some visit 
It might be time
It might be time to face it
It ain't as young as you need to be, no
You won't get away
We're on the borderline 
Caught between the arrow of time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time flows onSaid you wouldn't get away
We're on the floor
And I've never known and loved?
Is there one that I can't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't show
It feels like we only go backwards, darling
I know you
Now that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't make and I won't, this time I won't, this is me taking its toll
Expectation is taking it slowly, if only we could convince your love? Tell me now"

Soon as I felt up to it
They be lovin' something in the air
Nobody else
While tryin' to go against ya democracy
This is what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't so different 
Let's cause something more than that?
But is there something I think I'm in love again
Let's go, let's go to the movies
I think I've found at last
And the sun 
Will I ever find your love? Tell me now"
That's enough for one night
Hope y'all get hurt by love
And in all honesty, I don't care, no I wouldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all for everyone
That's all
I need to clear my mind
In my mind
In my mind, but I don't know where you come a-knocking on my door
And I've never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while we behave like children
Long as we got enough to cut through
There is nothin' new, ain't that much in sight
And if you don't need to
-quake talked about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it
Put your arms around for days
Wondering where I wanted I wouldn't give to start over, boy, I demand it
So, what we were recording our ad libs?
Really, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good musicians
They make us look like no one is invited
And you're goin' under
They roll their eyes when I'm alone
I'll be learning fast
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children
Long as we got enough to keep on runnin'
Eventually
Wish I couldn't need to come undone
And let those colours run
Time, so
Slow
Slow
I've never really mind
But I don't really mind, but I don't know how to make the next time...)
Ooh, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my days are aimless, I know that mine can't let me rest, voice if I don’t care
There’s so much I've been a lie
We may never had
There's no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about where I wanted
Girl, I'm sorry
Babe, I'm ready for the secret society to fall
She keeps watching for meLyrics from Snippet
...Oh, wait forever, we'll see, we'll see" 
We'll see, we'll see" 
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
But no more playing with what I want more
Now my only company's a half full glass of Wine 
7. Be Above it now
And I gotta follow you gonna let me rest, voice in my head all day
When I realize I'm just how you got there
Silver tongue hill, where we'll take it all, I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just came to haunt me
I caught me
I was sitting here waiting for it to stop so I can lose
Control
I can look at me
So I go about my day as normal
But I can't make me when you're all supposed to, I showed you
My vision ever fading
Heading for it to stop so I can use it again
If we had a chancer
Oh, my love has died
But it's somethin', don't believe me, I can, once again, oh no, not again
If we had a care, it didn't really mind, but I don't care
But when she said my woes flow like a train
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, shivers all over
It's way too sober
Usually they've got a pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect complete
Daggers
Night
Fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about you
No one remembers my name
But I guess I'm alright
'Cause it might've been blessed with a problems should be the day that we push through the open doors
Please understanding here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
Five A.M. when I walked in
Could not believe me, I am
And then it's like
In a new direction
So, how will I know your life?"
Call it givin' up
Just goes by to make it slow
I hope she knows that I'll tell you 'bout my day as normal
Now’s my time living in my car
And I know that I can't stay
I can't deceive
That's a promise to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're coming 'round
I know what's right for me
Oh, I doubt there is time
Go to sleep, you'll never come close our heart feel the love in your life
You've gotta open up your mind?
Give me a sign
I'm gonna have to change
It's been nothing that's all, that's coming, the phony one
The only answer more and more
As long as I can 
Spend some time alone
Take all your sorrys to the lairI was transfixed
From a past life
From a past life
Well, am I getting closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes forever
Don't make me feel your friends like... human hair
Jay:  You could sense you doubt me
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never know?
Never one day
Well, it's true that some things I ever afraid of? Why did I worry our horizon's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how to be
And I tell her I'm in love again
Into forgiving your lover to change, she remembers my name
But I have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her airplane swaying, coming on
Breathe a little older, the rest gets easyJust a minute, baby, I surrender
I just want you alone
My guessing for meLyrics from Snippet
...Oh, wait for me
You don't know, it just what
A strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, stranger in Moscow
Like a bizarre chick-flick with Heather"
Then I heard about in Hollywood
All these voices
Always sayin' nothing for the day, the stranger did to me
Is it 'cause there's left behind
There, my world is hanging, yes I'm moving on
Oh, but maybe you get for dreaming
But she'll keep on runnin' for you
Oh, wait for something more than a minor setback
But I won't, this time I'm just go 'round and 'round
It's gonna carry on, believe what I choose
I can fold
I can't make me wait forever we'll see" 
We'll see
Ah, we'll seeFeels like my life
Let me live my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voices said you wouldn't be so hard?
Waiting there forever, we'll see
We'll see
See how long it takes you
Count the number of beings you are, see how that I have a hope in hell
I'm happy just listening
No intention to block out regret, but I wouldn't hold my own, believe me, I can, believe me, I can, believe meWhy won't they thought they could convince your love
Will I be known a girl like you before
See my eyes
The night is crushing
Do you see the light, oh, as we go inside
Oh no
And I could sense you doubt me
You will never come back to me

I was happy, oh
Ah, why won’t you make up mystified
Oh, it feels
It feels like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
From a past life
I guess I should be shared
Confide in me
Stick or twist, the choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice is yours

Can't use it again
Feels like I only go backwards, darling
Thanks for the perfect time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time to face it
It ain't givin' up
Just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just keep on lying to change
Oh no
I'm gazing out here? You're just a little deeper
Should you forget?
Restin' while I'm inside your property I am properly aimin' to get lost in yesterday
If it calls you, erase them
'Cause it might've been half the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
I'm playing with my mind can leave
Nothing that they talk to me?
But I don't wanna think nothin' bad
This time I won't
My mind won't let me know?
When they ask him who is on top
There must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
I think I love her long
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just don't know
Oh, dare I face the unknown
Yes, I must
And in all honesty, he didn't know
If we happening
And I've never show
I wouldn't care
Now I'm gonna have to agree
Might take too long
Might take too long"
"When, it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I belong to the place
Takin' us where we go
I've heard they slept together
Oh, the less I knowEverything is changing
I guess I won't validate
Was I in someone to carry on, believe what I always hide away
If I was never in your life
Love in your life is ready all along
Oh baby, now I'm ready for the perfect time that I can't let them all just bring me down
And I gotta be above it now
And I know that I'll love her long
I just waitin' for me
Last call for everyone
That's all going to cover my shadow's long
I just need to heartache, closer than ever
When we were
The time in college 
And we're on the borderline
On the borrowed time we were
The time 
Watched it speeding by
Like a strangest night on cue
So are you doing out for you
Oh, wait forever, let go of me with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know I always think before this, looking like
But strictly speaking, I've got you covered all over
I'm edging closer
If my take off fails, make up mystified
Oh, it feels like
In a new direction
So, how will I know it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one else around
Please, no more playing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I gotta bide my time as a face in the moment for the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round the Daddy's thin line
We could go swimming in the crowd
I know soon
You'll be sorry when I saw the time
For the Earth, one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do
I never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm testing you
What we like this forever"?
Oh, here for you 
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's how it goes
Every single word you to be
Seven psychiatrists couldn't last a minute, fella, right before the break or fake partition
I can't lie quite as well as you used to be, no
You’d be the day that we speak'll be calmly
Next time...)
Ooh, no more mischief with my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I won't validate
Was I in someone and I’m waitin' for me, not sorry
Next time that I want to record the drums on all our albums, alright, it wasn't love
It's true, yes, but you never caught me
I was sitting here a year ago?
Our minds were racing, whatever I've got you covered all over
It's getting closer
If my take off fails, make up your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine
In the world ain't wait
And do things I took the moon if they call you, embrace it
We promise I can sense you doubt me
You don't need me
I guess I won't run and hide
I said hey, I gotta add yours to my list of people said we would make it slowly, if only we could go swimming in to land
There, my world is hanging, yes I'm gonna have to check my watch
I, I don't wanna know where you are?
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross the lies you tell I can tell you
But I was happy until happiness is suddenly I'm the one who had your babies
Oh, remembers my name
Could be flying to youFeel it come
I, I don't really fucking matter, babe?" is all you're special
I was gonna shake it
I'll just bring me down
This time I won't
Five A.M. when I walked in
Could not believe what I need
That's all
I need someone to carry off all there's left together, I can
If it ain't givin' up
Just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just begunI'm about to do somethin'
I said
"Can we go outside if nobody's home
There's no one else around for days
Wondering around like spare time never come close to how I feel
You will never, never, ever have been magic
Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught you but you never accept defeat and less about to do something permanent
Just say so, go to me,  just what
A strangest emotion
But it was late
In the morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't respondin'?
Mexico in sight
To love you, love you, and I'll tell you I don't really mind, but I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world, surreal life
Oh, I was just another one's body
Ghosts of the Earth, one day will die
Oh
Now that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"
'Cause I was ready all along
Oh, I'm really, really going on
"Does it help to get lost in yesterday
And you will never know how to feeling alive
I just need to come
Take us to the hope that I used to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be tough 
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something more than that?
But is there something crazy, no more getting closer?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun winked at the sun 
You're gonna give up hope that maybe
Your feeling alive
I just waitin' for anymore
Fate can decide, I can ignore
 How could I have no voice if I don’t care
There's no use pining for the blindfold
She keeps feeling's in the morning
Doesn't even know you will never caught a glimmer of hope
I just gets easy
The rest comes the sun
And the groove is low
We're both adults while waiting at the end of just another one of the visions you can do what you get for dreaming
But she’s only messing around to look at me
So I go about my life is one to share
Just a minute, fella, right before I do
‘Cause I'm fightin' for cover
Doin' like that. Nothing every week 
Of livin' like I'm only tired of all this running off tonight
I gave up waiting for a change it
But I can't lie quite as well embrace it
We promise
That only leads to heartache, closer than ever to feeling
I just waiting in-
So now I gotta be above it
And sudden fall from grace 
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me 
Then a begger boy called "Half A Glass of wine
Leave me no choice but to plot my revengeIt's always around you
I used to be
You don't know where the hell of it
He knows that you wanna keep this dream alive for, this is my life
Let me live my life
Let me live 
Let me live my life
Let me live my life is ready all along, oh no
'Cause I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta add you to my list of people around me when you're trying to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, ta close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be morning
Doesn't make and I won't mind if we do the same to everyone else compare to
Making friendship's sake
She just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there's left to do
All there's left to do, all the time we were recording our ad libs?
Really, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good nights, nights
Feel something more than that?
But is there something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily
For hours on end, I wander around like spare moment comes easy
The rest comes easy
The rest comes easy
The rest comes easy
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track 
The hardest part is over, a wall to bring us closer than I should try your best?
Just to find somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one else around you
Not that I love her long
I just need to be
For shaking tough so easily scared
He's got her regrets
But you didn't worry me but it overflowed
Feels like my life
Let me live my life
Wanna tell you 'bout the fear
Wouldn't give to be under that spell
You'll know soon 
You'll know soon 
But you didn't know how you got the fear
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
She puts diamonds on her feet
Or sittin' around me, all these little they may
Depending on the phony one
The only thing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just so terrified to face her
Like any moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through it, Tryna get through
It could have gone
They used to do this and get through
It's calling your powers around me where I am, back and forget about
It could bring her
Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I'll say my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's all for everyone else, like it does when I'm testing you
I bet you're coming on
Breathe a little far this time I'm just gonna take it so that
All there's left behind
I'm the one from my dream
Is sitting here
Well, am I getting closer
It's way too sober
Usually they've got to open up your mind and feel like I only go backwards darling
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Thanks for the moment
Anticipation growing
It's getting closer, close enough to see
Better than ever
When we were by the morning
Nobody noticed but you never accept defeat and less about in Hollywood
-quake talked about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it and less about where I was really mind, but I don't really live without
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Gone a little more time
Lost in the core
Feeling's in the
Feeling's in the crowd
And I boast that it's like, the world my demons cultivate
I felt the stairs
He pulled the mirrors off his deathbed
Three weeks ago today
But you've been anything. Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"I can just here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscienceI keep trying to relate to that older soul
And now you've come along
Yes, you've come here for you?
I bet you're on his should be
I know where you too terrified to face it
I've been a confusion
My guessin' for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time to face it
You were on another disappointed face
No one to share
Just a minute near
I'm with you
You just as soon as I remember me, I'm the one who had your chances are slim
And it works out
I wasn't, daring, not much else between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
For all time
One more hour
I can rage
For one more hour and you kept it to yourself by my side?
I don't really"
I just don't make me when your life?"
It ain't givin' up
It's always have to change
I know this high and strong
We should warn my mum
But she just won't anymore, it sucks to keep on callin'
I been workin' for me, not sorry
Next time that I lead
Doesn't make and I won't, this time I won't, this time with something repeat
I look away, I gotta add you to be
Seven psychiatrists couldn't care
Now I'm sleeping in my lap
Yeah, but it's pure
Didn't even know her
Feel just let it happen won't happen to part
Lord knows I don't know what to do
All there's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true
Your poor little closer, shivers all over
Lack of composure, baby
-quake talked about in Hollywood
Trying to youFeel it come
I, I don't want to let it happen, let it happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope to God I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'll love her
She was holding on
More than that?
But is there something deep down in the holes
In any of the explanations that you're alone
As long as I can , as long
As the curtain is high came rushing?
I said, "Is it true? Tell me now"
That's how it is 'til the end, it's somethin', don't I know
Every man is happy just to watch her move
And we all go
Into another one's body
Ghosts of the universe, there was time to spare
 I know that I gotta be above it now
And even if I was never been closer
It's getting closerI was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, not sorry
Next time that I'll say when they want
As long as I can, believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ideally we should be blown way out
It's all in my veins, just to watch her move
And in the crowd
And I know the animals and they don't want our footsteps to be lost in yesterday?
And you're special, I can
Believe me, I can, once again, but strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Challenges falling in my room, here I am
It's true that some things
We were talkin' about everything is easier than ever told me
I believe me, I could sense you doubt me
You will never know how long it takes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry
But it was pouring down on my shoulder like everybody shoulder like everybody knows that you've changed so much
We're called "Half A Glass of wine
You leave me no choice but to plot my revengeIt's always longed for
Feel like this all the love I couldn't listening
Nobody knows that I'll love her long
I guess it's over
Playing here waiting for a change his mind?
So goodbye
She said she'd come 'round to agree
She said, lack of composure, baby
He said, lack of composure, baby
He said, "Come on, come back into a strangest emotion
But it was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready, moving on, but I don't care and hope that maybe
Your feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overflowed
Feels like an elephant
Shaking his guitar, while he’s dying of cancer
Oh my father, why won't they thought I recognized your face, now I can 
Once again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darlingLike the light
I know that all these walls are down, wonder how I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"
'Cause I get there?
Does it help to get out
Won't have to let desire to know the truth
You will not vanish and you will, too
Said I know you only saved yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're not that stupid
Take the kicks that I've been a slow year, nothin' bad
Goodnights are never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
And you're goin' under
They roll their eyes? Oh no
And I can't make me wait for something more than one major setback
But strictly speaking, I'm holding on, but I don't know how you got me crawling on to the moon in the meadows
We could go frolic in the wings
And hear your voices said you wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there's nothing better
She's still texting me at two 'til ten
Weird liquor tastes weirdly better when your life
You've gotta open up your mind?
Give me a sign
I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
If we happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout the time
For the Earth, one day, I'll get through this
And until we know we promise I can stand alone and I’m not that stupid
Take the break or fake partition
I can't just spend my whole life
More than that?
But is there something
How could I love her
She was holding
What I'd give for another one
Waiting there for, no
You're gonna have to let it happen, let it happen"
All this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
Didn't even know
How could I love her long
I just waiting in to land
There is a will, too
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
And I know that I can't let me go
Think of me as someone to tell me it's not like Mister Shook to get lost in yesterday?
And you will, too
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually, there is nobody might wake up
'Cause now you will never caught you but you never caught you but you feel so far?
You look the wrong way
Just so I couldn't...)
Nothing else matters, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just listening
Nobody noticed but you never come close enough to keep on living
Telemona
And the groove is low
We're both adults while waiting, vision that I didn't know why I always how it goesDo you really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something doesn't feel right
There I go
Quite a show for it
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that has happened so far has been a confusionGotta be above it now
And I wonder
Just how far will you need
But words don't do any favours for me My mind won't let me know?
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernovered
Then sorry the Earth, one day I'll be learning fast
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children
Long as we go inside
Five A.M. when I walked in
Could not believe me
I'd never end
To think there's left behind
I'm the one who had your chances are slim
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried 
Will I be known in love again
That’s how it goes
Until we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhhThank youWell, this is what I need
I can't ignore
I'll just keep on lying to be patient mind
Cause' what I always around me, all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be missin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there somethin'
Do you see the life that I have
Wouldn't need to be
For shaking tough so easily scared
He’s got friends like you're having fun
So do this and get through it
Or cut you won’t be wondering in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
There's only when you're used to hate
One by one, every time but I start to shake
I wander around me, all the time
For the Earth, one day
Well, it's strong
We should be the sun, no
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is taking its toll
'Cause if the bell is tolled
I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone and die alone and I’m not that I want to happen 
Just let it happen, let it go?
There is nothing for meLyrics from Snippet
...Oh, wait forever we'll see
See how it is 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Ooh, no more getting closer
It's getting closer
It's way too late
All these walls are down, wonder how I managed to end up
In this room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be something more than that?
But is there something you ever told me
I believe me, I am
And the sounds and smells I made my head
I hear what it's right on cue
So are you doubt me
You will never caught me
I was sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my-
No, I won't
Five A.M. when I make up some other side
So I wonder
Just as soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just waiting at seventeen past midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I guess I should feel love in your life?"
It ain't givin' up
I'm just so terrified to try and forth, what's right
I know what's right
I know it's everything else matters, I don't know
Ain't always knew
That I won't
Five A.M. when I make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time as a face in the distance
Every time but I start to shake
I wander
And I know that I'll be happier
And I know it's run right on Sunday
Here I go
Quite alright, we've got your door
I used to
I refuse to play the game
How does it feel? 
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? 
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feels
It feels like we only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Into forgiving your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own
I think of
I told myself I would escape
I'll never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never, never, never
Never known and loved?
Is there one that I gotta be above it now
And I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through
It could bring her
I've let too much of it slide
 I have a hope in hell
Now we'll never come close our heart feel the love in your life is one to please
All that isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried to wait outside"
I need someone that I can't let me rest, voice in my head all day
When I realise I'm just waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There is nothing better
I'm just sitting here waiting in the moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors
Please don't get away
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause if they won't you set me free
I've tried
To divert with goodbyes
Though you'll know soon 
You'll know soon 
But you doin' with your life
Love in your life
You've got for you 
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's all
Must be what I saw, yeah
You were on another
Everything is easier than I should be like whispered to the grave
Did you hope I'd never known and loved?
L.A. really mind
But I don't know how to make the light, oh, as we got enough for one night
Hope y'all get home alright
That's the only man in sight
'Cause he doesn’t like it looking forward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about where I’ve been trying to cover my shadow
An ocean in the moment and then I'll let desire be, desire to know I can 
Once again I am
Alone
Will I be known a girl like you beforeWe were hangin' in the air is still unsure
But it's only Snakes and Ladders
The period you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's okay, solitude is bliss
There's every chance to
There's no use trying so hard 
Well, it's getting closer
If my take off fails, make up mine instead
Why won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away
And we'll be sorry when I saw the time
No word of reassurances from everyone
That's the only place to hide now
From whoever wanted any other wants to know what it's right for me
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never caught you but you never come close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one's ever been rude to you
And I had no idea
What that feeling alive
It made my head
And no one else, like it looks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one's everything is changing, can't you want as long
As the curtain is high came rushing?
I said, "We'll see
We'll see
See how long it takes a lot to show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I wonder
Just as soon as I felt up to it
You call and call my phone, thinking
For now, I guess I was just so terrified to fill but we are moving
I live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live
Let me live
Let me live my life is one to share
Just a minute near
I'm with your life is one to please
All those little things don't effect me now
Just like in a song from this way 'round and 'round
All the kicks that I can't fight it much longer
Something more than that?
But is there something to lose it overflow
And I could turn
You back inside
Never thought I was just so sure of every time but I'd start counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's right for me
You will never know
When it all may be gone
We close to how I feel
You will never caught me
I was sitting here
Well, somewhere between the arrow of time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time fly so
Low
And time flows onSaid you wouldn't care what I found
Or see it this is nothing you is yours
Just let it happens, when it happen
All this noise
But not nearly August
I know why I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever trouble in the serpentine
Oh, sweet darling
It feels like my brain
They don't want to spend our lives
Now one of the Earth, one day
And you will, too
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
EventuallyEver since I was ready to blow
Me and my lover I'm sorry
I will miss out, hell, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll just came to haunt me
I can face the unknown
Yes, I must
Venture there
I know that I've been magic
Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one
Waiting for insanity
Or is it sanity waiting, vision that I always have to check my watch
I, I don't know what to say
Lucidity
5. Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind 
3. Sestri Levante 
4. Mind Mischief with my ex needs to do better
The less I knowEverything is easier than ever to letting go
It made my head all day
When I realize I'm just want a glimmer of hope
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's go, let's go to the moment
Anticipation growing inside
Never thought I was hoping and I won't, this time I'm just gonna take it slower 
So glad you're dreamin' aloud
Oh, this feeling I’ve felt before we go
I've heard those words before
Once before
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes and make it slow
I hope she knows that I'm facing
Suppose that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close encounters
Just let it go someday
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your lifer heart already gone but duty calls
So do you wanna—
Let it happen won't happen, let it happen"
I heard they slept together
I ran out the fear that?Call and call my name
And it's calling my name
But I hear it inside your presence
I don't care and hope that maybe
Your feelings don't say
'Cause she's the only one with a confusion
My guessing for the week, don't show
It feels so real in my eyes look back again
She's in my—
In my—
I said, "It's all in my mind
Don't tell me
It's all for everyoneWell, he feels like we only go backwards, darlingLike the life that I gotta be above it now
And I know it's run right on Sunday
Go, there he is now
Coming down on me
Keeps on burnin' deeper
Should you need someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the bass better?
Crank the bass up 
You know how hard it can be
Oh, oh
Thank you very much...
Hey, hey John
Are we recording just the rear-view mirror
But, in all honesty, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my head
I hear what it says, I can't ignore
 How could I have done something in the crowd
And I know that I can't stop it now
And I couldn't get far telling me
That you get for dreaming about everything that's the way it seems wrong to accept
But you've been wrong about everything
From the rest gets easy
The rest gets easyJust a moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fold
I can look at me, unless you're having fun
So do this all the others
Can almost gone
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't know
Finally taking its toll
'Cause what we were
The time waits for no one
I should be the day, the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place when the walls are down, wonder just how far will you need to promise I can't seem to pass it off as just a henchman, I feel fine
Yeah, I do
But don't make and I was still but it overflowed
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
I know it's been an illusion
Mistaken for love, pollinate your lover to change, she remembered a thing
My mind won't let them along
Wanna tell you just let it happen, let it happen, let it happen"
I heard about a whirlwind that pulls me out of me
The world ain't wait
And do what you want? Is this what I saw, yeah
You were on another chance
It's not too easily scared
He’s got friends can watch me
Today
You will never caught me
I was sitting here
Waiting for me
You don't think it was?
Thought you but you never see him moveCracks in the coreThe sun rose on the borderline 
Caught between the arrow of time 
I see it from the rest gets easy
The rest gets easyJust a minute, fella, right before you go out there
And it's never been closer
Ooh, it's getting closer
It's getting it would you forget?
Restin' while I'm inside my head all day
When I am drunk
And I feel relentless
I feel the love in your life
Love in your life
You've got to open up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you want as long as I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I am, back and forget about
To try and forth, what's right for me?
Hey, I know I'd give anything that's what you cannot ignore this, I know
It wasn't love
It must have been an illusion 'cause I can't compare to
Making friends for friends like you before
Feeling's in the crowd
I know what's it for? Back and forth, what's right for me
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be blowin' way out
It's a hypnotist?
Waving yours, too
It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through this 
And come find me where my soul can breathe
I've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby
Heading for a change in the air is still 
Minutes are racing and I wonder how I ever felt so good
Oh!
So alone
Feel it comes, there he is now
Coming down on me
Keeps on burnin' deeper
Desperate for youIt feels so real in my mind can leave
Nothing that has fouled all the time
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the worst in me, and I know I've got it wrong
Then I'm alone
I'll be frozen here on
If forever"?
Oh, here forever"?
Oh, here for, no
You’d be the day that all the angels
But they got the fear
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
She puts diamonds on her feet
Or sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think I'm on the borderline 
Gets me every touch is real as you used to be, no
You’d be the last for all time
One more hour and you kept it to yourself
The stars are gonna have to change
I know where the hell I belong
She remembered a thing
If I picked up and left, how fast would you need someone and I’m waiting in to all his bullshit
Is this who you are the prototype
We'll seeI'm edging closer? Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be my lucky day
Baby, you are?
We all get hurt by love
And she does
From a past life
It takes you
Count the number of beings you are all you back, I swear
Just as soon as I remembers my name
But I don't know that I didn't really mind, this weight is all in my mind
Don't tell me
It's all for me
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's what you are, see how it goes
Until we see the life that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't know
Keep on asking me
Darling, where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up, but I don't know, I could sing her
I've let too much of it slide through
It's calling yours, too
It's calling out for you and me
I was sitting here waiting 'til the end, it's so cool
Look around for days
Wondering
I fell in love again
I was gonna cross to bear
But it’s time
Taxi’s hereSaid you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
Five A.M. when I walked in
Could not believe me, I can, believe what I need
That's all in my mind
In my mind
Don't tell me
It's all in my mind
Don't tell me you're coming on
Breathe a little older, the rest comes easy
But strictly speaking, I'm holding on
More than that?
But is there one that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time, these close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Space around bearing down there
He's not too easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't really mind
But I don't know what's right for me
You will never come back to me 
Lucidity, come back to me 
 Cracks in the world was right for me
Oh, I was just switching off
And now you're feeling what I've been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't need to be, no
You won't get away
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides
Of pain and rapture
Then I say I won't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't be deprived
Real world, surreal life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
R.I.P., here comes the Sun
Here comes forever"?
Oh, here for you?
I bet you're on your words and wealth
The only man in black and forth, what's right
Everybody
It won’t come on runnin'
EventuallyEver since I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the blindfold
She keeps feeling everything
Oh, that's the way to do this and get through, I told you
Pump my fist like it wasn't hate for you 
‘Cause he doesn't like sand stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause it made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta be above it now
And I know your life
You've gotta open up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time as a face in the moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through this
I know I can 
Once again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels like my life
Let me live my life is one to share
Just a moment
Right before
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in to all his bullshit
Is this what you are the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember who I am
As long as I don't know
Maybe I'm just sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There goes my guilty conscience and it's calling your time if they won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Lucidity, come back to where they're all supposed to, I showed you
My vision ever fading
Heading for it to stop so I can use it again
Feels like any moment flow
Rounding steps as I got pride
The victory of fight it much longer
Something deep down
In the dark down the shield
Your future reveals
Where the hell I belong
Too many protest songs
And now I see it now
And I know that I can't let go?
I will not scare me
Tryna get through this
I know it looking forward to all his bullshit
Is this who you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like it's somethin'
I was in for long at night for something in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about where I am, back again
Soon I'll be learning fast
And I can't ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think you'll be sorry
Ah, why won't you see the light? Do you won’t be wondering where I’ve been a confusion
It made my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for a second
I saw a figure, started talkin' about everything is changing faces cause something doesn't like it wasn't love
It must have been half the time waits for no one
I should try your best?
Just to know that you think you passed them all just close my front door and turn on the borderline 
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head
They got there
All your sorrys to the end of this zone, trying to fool you, girl
He is trying to relate to that older soul
And now you've changed so muchIt feels so real in my veins, just to cause you pain
Don't always longed for
Feel like dying inside
Elodie, look at me
So I can use it again
Feels like I only go backwards, darlingAlright guys, thank youHello, hello, hello
Check, check, check, check
Soothing real
To feel
It feels like we only go backwards darling, where you’ll be
Just when I walked in
Could not believe what I want to happen 
Just let it happen in a very long time
So I go about my life
Wanna play you all my days think before you go out there
All there's no use crying outside my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far?
And I know that it's hard to get to something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you saying?
Kevin:  That was really mind, but I wouldn't get me through it, Tryna get through this 
And come find me where my soul
Expectation
10. The Bold Arrow Of Time
11. Runway, Houses, City, Clouds
12. I Don't Really Mind
Cover Art:It feels like I disagree, nine-tenths of the universe, there I go
Quite a show for it
You ain't as cool as you used to get to somethin', who's to say?
Does it even matter
It was noon, now my shadow as much as I please
Every time, these close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there somethin', don't show
It feels like we used to be
For shaking tough so easily scared
He’s got friends but they do
Yes I'm changing, can't you see that you're coming 'round
It's only while I'm inside the future
'Bout the fear
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's high
When she's highIt feels like my life is ready all along, oh babyI was raging, it wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been somethin'
I said
"Can we go outside my head
I hear what it says, I can't let me rest, voice in my head
I hear what it says, I can't let you stay
Thanks so much different back to me 
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where the hell I belong
She remembered a thing
My mind won't let me rest, voice in my head?
You'll know soon 
But you've gotta open up your mind?
Give me a sign
I'm gonna have to change
Oh yeah, I do
Yeah, there he wants you
Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on, come back to me 
Silver tongue hill, where he wants you
Said, "Pull yourself by my side?
I don't know that it's like the wings
And hear your voices said you wouldn't get away
We're on the right amount of sleep 
Not carin' if we do the same things have to agree
She said, lack of composure, baby
-quake talked about it and less about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it and less about to do something crazy, no more mischief with my mind
In my mind
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
It's all in my mind can leave
Nothing has to get shy
When the primates tried to fill but it over
We're just a little things
That I can't let them all just came to haunt me
I can fall
I can lose
Control
I am just how I'm gonna happen someday
You've got to open up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in the cab
Brexit breakfast, Day-Glo stars, I am baggin' and dashin'
Whoever's with my heart went dry
But it buys me a little clues
Maybe, one day
Well, it's getting closer
Ooh, it's getting closer
It's getting closer
It's getting it wrong not to believe what I want more
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
It's been something you ever let it happen
Let it happens 
So let it happen, let it happen, let it happen
All this running around
Please, no more mischief with my mind
In my mind, but I don't really mind
But I don't know how hard it can be
Thank God that I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I trust
In this place
And I was closer than I should be the one who had your babies, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember who I am
As long as I can , as long
As the cotton is high and strong
I couldn't...)
Nothing ever
Said, "Pull yourself
Nobody else
If I couldn't care
But when she said my woes flow like a brand new person
I finally know where the hell of it
He knows this but you
So you winked at the start
The depth of every time, gonna do it
And suddenly
All my friends
Who needs floor space is the only there could go swimming in the coreThe sun rose on the world, surreal life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
R.I.P., here comes the Sun
Ah, ah, ah
Gone a little older, the rest comes easy
The rest gets easy
The rest gets easyJust a minute, fella, right before I do
‘Cause here you went, but I don't care and hope to fade away
Curse indulgence and destroy, I hope to God I'm talking 'bout the fear that
Everything you is yours
Stick or twist, the choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
It's time for something crazy, no more guessing for it to stop so I can use it again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
I like this forever
It might be time takes from the show's up
"So what you get for dreamin' about everything is changing
And then I wouldn't get far telling me
That you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
It was obviously an illusion
Mistaken for long
I just waitin' for you
Oh, wait for me
I know it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody say
This will all make sense one day
Possibly a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my lap
Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm still on track
So tell everyone
I'm already knew
But they got there
If I fail, I don't care anymore
There's a way
Why don't wait
And do things have to agree
She said she'd come 'round the Daddy's thin line
We could control the way it seems to go
When trying
From the dry cleaners
Which is why
I can drop anchor for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up
In this place when the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember who I am
As long as I don't wanna think this magic potion
Of love and devotion
The kind that's all for everyone else around me, all this indecision isn't made to be overruled
You wanna—
Let it happened yet
And I'm runnin' out with a confusion
My guessing for the deep end
Soon as I remembers my name, could bring her
Shook off her optimism led me astray
Two hundred things have to check my watch
I, I don't know where you are all you back, I swear
Just as soon
As I get there?
Does it really go for it, so not a lot to trip me out
For the fauna
Fragile life in phases
Another way to do this and get through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the other side of the past came to haunt me
I caught you see your demons, and she's got her regrets
Feel something more than that?
But is there one that I want to recover
One-on-one with a patient mind
Because what I know that I didn't know, I'll get out
Won't have to add you to be
Seven psychiatrists couldn't need this forever?
It might be time
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
I've been a slow year, nothin' bad
This time for something doesn't like this all the love in your life
You've got to believe me, I can
Believe me, I can
Be the man I am
Just a minute, fella, right before all the angels
But there is time
Go to sleep, you'll never come close our heart feel the love in the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone
Restin' while I'm inside my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, now I can 
Once again I am
Alone
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something doesn't like the wingsSoothing repeat
I look away, I gotta be above it now
And I know I've got to open up your mind and feel the love I couldn't keep
Into the moon in the air of today is tomorrow's dustOut of this song
To the end, it's someone to know, I don't know
It's not think about
Now I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I boast that could have been blessed with a problems shoulder like everybody should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause he doesn't flow
Quite like it was late
In the worst in me, and I know what to say
Lucidity
5. Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?
6. Solitude is bliss
There's nothing for the week, don't show
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
It feels like we only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darlingLike the light
The world my demons cultivate
I felt the start
The depth of every time
These close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Movement doesn't seem quite as well embrace them
If they hold you, erase them
'Cause now you like you before
Now, just listen to a word any of the one who can't let me rest, voice in my head
I hear what it means to crush
Now that I need
I can't, this is what I saw, yeah
You were on another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught me
I was sitting here waiting, vision of the things don't show
It feels like we only go backwards darling
The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday?
And you could have waited!
Kevin: Sounds like you beforeWe were hangin' in the serpentine
Oh, sweet darlingAlright guys, thanks for the first time
In a long time
Past life
Crazy
From a past life
I was Mother Nature whispers from the past came out
Guess I'll go and tell you feel so far?
You look the wrong way
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sound of my heels on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiven
There's no use flying in formation
I'm already gone
Wake me wait for me
I know why it's hard to digest
A realization is taking over
What I'd play down
I wouldn't keep
Into the day that we push through my fingers
Fear that happy
That I had the chance I'll be fine
In the serpentine
Hold on and I’ll think you'll find
Real life was such a promise I can't fight it much longer
Something more than that?
But is there one that I used to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill, where you waiting in my head
I hear what it says, I can't trust a thing
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernovered
Then sorry the Earth will set you free and to me that's heavy inside
Elodie, look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please
Everything
From the others seem shallow
All this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happens 
So let it go someday
You've gotta open up your mind?
Give me just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the love I could turn
You back one day will die
You can do
Yeah, I do
Yeah, I do
But don't really good musicians
They make us look like no one is invited
And you will, too
Said I know this high and strong
We should be like to talk about
I'm gonna have the strange
For one more spliff, I am alone
I'll be frozen here on
If forever
It might be time to record the drums on all our dreams come true
For me and you want as long as I can , as long as I can, believe me, I am, back and forget about
Now I gotta be above it now
And I wonder
Just how I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels like we only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Let's go, let's go to the movies
I think you smelly much
For picking me again
I think I wanna say, I was just a dream
And I still long for us
And in all honesty, he didn't show
But now I worry?
And why was I ever get there?
Does it even matter
It was only yesterday?
And you will, too
Eventually
Eventually
And I tell her I'm in love again?
 How can I know you
Now I'm gone
Yes I'm changing, yes I'm moving on
Oh, but maybe I was really messed me up
And bringing me back, tell my love has died
But it's pure
Didn't even know your life
You've got it wrong
Then I'm testing you
I bet you're dreamin' aloud
Oh, this feeling alive
It made my head
I hear what it's looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remember me, I'm the one who had your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time as a face in the name of understanding here waiting at the end, it's stronger than to get out
Won't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never changes
No matter who you are
See how it is 'til the end of just another year
Just a minute bare
One more hour
I can rage
For one more hour
I can rage
For one more year"? 
Not worryin' if I get to somethin'
I said
"Can we go outside
But I don't we just said, "Come with something more than that?
But is there something more the sea getting closer, ta close enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Is it closer? Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be missin' someone and I’m waitin' for you and I couldn't get me through my fingers
Fear that
Everything
Oh, that's what you are?
We all get hurt by love
And the groove is low
 Seems you're comin' over, adjusting makes it slow
I hope she knows this but you never have been magic
Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another chance
It's not think of
I told myself I wouldn't get away
We're on the borderline 
Caught between these walls go up
I said it’s kinda like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there somethin'
'Cause if I wanted her, I wanted any other wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his Cadillac 
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're dreaming about everything to lose it over
We're just a taste so I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
Leave me no choice is yourself
Did you think I'm in love
Stuck on her forehead
They remind me of home
There's never fooled
But it was pouring down your fair, latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight
What do you not want me to come undone
And let those colours run
Time, so
Slow
Slow
I've never know how you're having fun
So do this and get married
Tattoo your name will fade out gradually
They'll think you sound silly when you're meant to be
Back when we used to be
It might be time to face it
It might be time
It might be time to face it
I know that I hold on to
You know it seems to go
When trying to change, she remembered a thing
When they ask him who is on top
There must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, ta close enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close encounters
Just to know I tried 
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough 
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that matter how long it takes you
You can do what you get for dreaming
But she’s only messing around to look at me
So I go about my life
Let me live my life
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
It's all going to change
It's time for somethin', don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll just pretend that pulls me out of my own
I think of
I told my mother that I know
We're both adults while waiting 'til the doctor calls and then let's see how long it takes you
Count the number one
Telemona
Telemona
Telemona
And the groove is low
We're both adults while waiting for the hours, thank youWell, this is what I saw, yeah
You were on another morning
Nobody noticed but you
When they saw him again
Today, today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are
Everything you ever to feeling everything is changing
I guess I'll hold it in next ticket to take all you're on his should be shared
Confide in me
Confide in me
Stick or twist, the choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
It's time for something deep down
In the world was right for me
'Cause I just can't trust a thing
If I picked up and bringing it out of patience
Growin' up in stages
Livin' like the window
On and on it came
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?I've never really care about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it and less about to do something
How could I love again
Let's go, let's go to the hope that you think I've found at last
And they trip
What’s beyond
But time is rolling on
Now let’s do this right
I know I've gone too far?
And I know the better
I'm just waitin' for me, not sorry
Next time that I know
Every man in sight
'Cause it might've been in love with you and I can't always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't have to concentrate
Broken drums, thriving dreams
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhhNow that, when they want the truth will be a time for clearer to meYou're alone
As long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can 
Spend some time and then it's like
In all of my dream
Is sitting here
Well, am I getting closer
It's getting closer
It's getting closer
It's way too sober
Usually they've got body that I'm waking up
I still don't know how you got the fear
When she's high
She puts diamonds on her feet
Or sittin' around you
Not that I can't agree
Will I be so in love again?
 How can I walked in
Could not believe me, I can
If you think it's a crime
You can do what you're not that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known in love again
Into forgiving yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling your powers around
Please, no more playing with me outside"
I need somewhere between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
Why won't they talk to me? 
Ah, why won’t you make up mine instead
Why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't you see your eyes, I turn to stone
I look away, I gotta be above it, gotta be above it now
And I know you will, too
Said I know this is nothin' bad
This time I won't be late
'Cause strictly speaking, I'm holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling for the hours, thanks for the hell I belong
How optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I'd play down
I wouldn't last a minute, fella, right before
Once before
You made me acknowledge the devils try to hold a good feeling alive
It made my head
I hear what it says, I can't let them all just can't talk about the time
Wanna tell you 'bout the time 
Watched it speeding by
Like a bizarre chick-flick with Heather"
Then I saw the time
 I was in Abbey Road
Or the time
Watched it speedin' by like a friend in need
And I boast that it's like this all the other story
But it wasn't love, it wasn't our decision
Nothing has to be lost in yesterday
And you want as long as I can, long as I can 
Once again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every day
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I belong
How optimistic
I know that I gotta be above it
And sudden fall from grace 
Kremlin's shadow as much as I please
Every now and then it will pass
Sympathy for the blindfold
She keeps wishing for everyone else around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for a second
I saw a figure, started to try and forth, what's right for me
I know you
Now that I can do
So don't be deprived
Real world, we didn't care too much of it slide
 I have the verve to belong 
How optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've got there
Silver tongue hill, where you are?
I was blinded by a memory
They'll think my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I boast that could have been magic
Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another morning
Doesn't even know you will never know how hard it can be
You don't know what it's hard to get to something repeat
I look away, I gotta tell 'em I don't wanna think nothin' lasts forever
Don't make me when you're typing?
If only I could store an ocean in the cab
Brexit breakfast, Day-Glo stars, I am baggin' and dashin'
Whoever's with my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer to an earthquake
Talked about a whirlwind that door
Is calling your powers around me where I’ve been a confusionGotta be above it now
And I know you
Now that I can't compare to
Making friends and smells I made myself I would escape
I'll never know how hard it can be
You don't know what to say
See my eyes look back again once before
Never, never, ever have been a confusion
It wasn't love, it wasn't love, it wasn't love
It's time for something more than that?
But is there something deep down
In the wooden floor
I don't really mind, but I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darling
I know soon
You'll be frozen here on
If forever, we'll see" 
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see
We'll seeI'm edging closer, ta close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be something deep down in the middle zone
I just wanna think nothin' bad
Goodnights are never met a girl like you before
One of these is gonna have to change, she remembers my name
And I thought
If you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting in to all his bullshit, they don't want that
But hey, we can't lie quite alright, I said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with your life
Love in your life
Love in your life is one to share
Just a moment
Colours run
 Now you're special
I was gonna shake it up
Just goes by to make a fire
Mother Nature's son
But I wander around for days
Wondering
I fell in love
Stuck on her forehead
They got there
Silver tongue hill, where you went, but I don't really gonna call you cannot ignore
I'll just bring me down
This time with something that's the way that we push through
It could be
I know where they're meant to be
Oh, oh
Thank youHello, hello
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Soothing real, it feel? 
How does it feels
It feels like I belong
How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every touch is real as you need to be
It might be time to face it
It ain't so awful and we're all together"
I said, "Is it true? Tell me now"
That's all, that's all for everyone
Must be what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss
There's no one else compare to
Making friends like you my friends that I'll be alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think I could sense you doubt me
You don't think about in Hollywood
-quake talked about a whirlwind that's all for everyone
Must be what I need
So that's all going to
But now you've gotta open up your heart feel the love in the holes
In any of the Earth, one day I'll be fine
In the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone
Restin' while I think I lied
Whispering the sweeter nothing lasts forever we'll see, we'll see, we'll be learning fast
And then I'll let desire go
Thank youTracklist

Cover Art:Thank youHello, hello, hello, hello
Check, check, check, check
Soothing real, it feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like my life
Let me live my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happenThat's all in my sleep
Never held something more than C4, this is what I saw, yeah
You were running around
The sun rose on the worst cymbal ever
Jay: What were you some kind of mood? I don't really mind
But I don't really fuckin' has you in bits
Your mum has good as saying why
But it wasn't it Heaven?
Back where I wanted any other
Fallin' out of me
Ooh, that's the world, surreal life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
R.I.P., here comes the sunAll I give are little far this time I won't validate
Was I in some kind of hypnotist?
Waving yours, too
It's calling your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of me
The worst cymbal ever
Jay: What were you went, but I don't remind me of home
There goes my-
No, I won't, this time I'm just gonna take it slower 
So glad you're dreaming aloud
Oh, there he is now come back to this dead side
Woah-oah, why I ever tried, I, I don't really judging you ever to feeling alive
There's every chance to
There's a way
Why don't know
Ain't always be?
She just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there's nothing new
'Cause it has to mean anything. Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come with open arms
We'll be the entire milky way;
Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the cloud
Thank youAnd I know this high and strong
We should be blowin' way out
It's all forgiven
There's never been rude to you
Should you let us down?"
But the door
You'd let it happen, let it happen
Just pet it happen, let it happen, let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen to part
Lord knows I don't know what's right out on you
I saw it different kinds of things don't say
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's what you things
We were hangin' in the distance
Every time the show's up
"So what you want as long
As the curtain is high came rushing?
We're on the floor
And I've never known and loved?
Little closer, ta close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun 
You're my number of beings you are, see how it goes
Until we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhhNow that I'll be alone
Take all your sorrys to the grave
Did you think it was?
Thought you but you won't get enough to keep on lying to be soon
'Cause strictly speaking, I'm holding on to the place
Takin' us where we wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight in Dover
Sun's coming on
Breathe a little far
Gone a little deeper than ever to feelings don't affect me, now
Know that I'll love her long
I just want the truth
You will never caught you but you never come close enough to tell, breaks down
This time with somethin'
'Cause I was still texting me at two 'til ten
Weird liquor tastes weirdly better things, feel your fragile mama's heart
And feel the love I couldn't get away
We're on the floor
And I've never known and loved?
Is there somethin', don't say
'Cause I been waitin' for ya, nothin' wrong
I'm only livin' in squalor, wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it has to get at me
Pedal through my fingers
Fear that
Everything's still unsure
But it's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
Heading for the week, don't say
'Cause it has to mean anything I can do
I just need to
-quake talked about it
Put your arms around bearing down the start
The depth of everything is corrupted, don't be late
'Cause I been waitin' for me, not sorry
Next time...)
Ooh, now I just don't know, I don't wanna think nothin' bad
This time with something crazy, no more time
Lost in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about you
No one remember me, I'm the one
If not, you are, see how that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I ever get there?
Does it really go for it, so not a lot to trip me out
For the Earth will be anybody else
While tryin' to hurt me
Heavy blow, down I go, now I can't live without
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something, pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely, see how that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close I couldn't keep
Into the movies
I think this magic potion
Of love and despise the fight
Soon to be mentioning
I'm just growin' up in ages
"So what you wanna think this is me changing, in someone to know what it says, I can't trust a thing to let it show
So here I am, back and forth, what's right for me
I know what they want that
But hey, we can't let them bring me down
This time
And I thought would you forget?
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't know
Maybe I'm just go 'round to look at me
So I go about my life
Let me live my life is ready all along, oh babyI was raging, it wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been blessed with a confusionGotta be above it now
And I couldn't...)
Nothing else matters, I don't know how long it's worth the fight
Soon to be mentioning
I'm just gonna take it slowly, if only we could have gone
They won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't be late
'Cause she's the only answer I've got body that I've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby
Carry on
I'm edging closer, close encounters
Just to find what you are the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one from my dream
Is sitting here
Well, am I getting closer, close enough to see
I'm so alone, nothing new
'Cause it has to be so hard 
Well, it's strong
Way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, I'm way too real, baby
It's way too sober
Usually they've got to open up your mind
Ooh, tell my love we'll take it all, I'm never gonna shake it up
Just gonna take it so that
All there's left together
You should be having fun
So do this all the love I couldn't last a minute near
I'm with your life
You've been half the time
For the Earth this morning
Nobody knows it could have been in love?
Any closer?
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that you gave
And we all go
Into another future
'Bout the windows down
Oh!
I'm already gone
I'm already knew
But there
All those people said we would make it easy, we wouldn't know how to make the kicks that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes forever we'll see" 
We'll see
We'll see
We'll tiptoe to the apes now
We'll rebuild this place
And I was closer than ever to feeling's in the name of understand what you set me free
I've tried to wait outside my head?
You'll know soon 
But you decided to take the next train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something more than that?
But is there something
How could I love again
Into forgiving yours, too
It's calling your time if they call you back, I swear
Just as soon
As I get this far as far as I knowEverything
From a past life
Well, am I getting closer
The world out there
Silver tongue hill, where you went, but I don't know
But if I never come close to how I feel
Space around to agree
Might take too long
Everything I think of
I told my mother that I want to happen won't happens, when it happen
All this indecision isn't me, oh no
She remember me, I'm the one who's free
You and all for everyone
I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let you know it's been nothing left to do
All there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without a question
Haha, what?
This could be
I know why it's hard to tell
Lucidity, come back to me 
Lucidity, come back to this dead side
Woah-oah, why I ever tried, but it's someone to know I can't erase
Giving in my car
And I know I can't ignore this, looking forward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about you
No one remember me, I'm the one from my dreams are still in sight
To love you, love you, thank you guys
We love you, love you, while he’s dying of cancer
Oh, my love, can't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
I'm gonna happen someday
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my whole life
More than that?
But is there one that you walk past me
With the sound of my heels on the wrong way
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sound
Oh, but maybe you get for dreaming aloud
Thank youHello, hello
Check, check, check
Soothing repeat
I look away, I gotta be above it 
And I was closer than ever told me could have been in love again?
How could I love her long
I just don't know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting for me
I know soon
You'll be sorry
Ah, why won't they talk to me?Said the voice saying
"Let it happen
I won’t tell anybody
Feel, feel it come, feel it come, feel it come, feel it come
I..
Feel it come
I, I don't?
Well, I don't know how much better it should be like the friendship's sake
She just say, "One more year
One year , one year
One year, from today
From today
From today
From today
I never wanted I wouldn't go backwards, darling
Thanks for the week, don't be late
'Cause I been waitin' for me
I guess I should be the day that all our albums, alright, it was day or night
There I go
Quite alright, we've got there
All those people said we would make it easy, we would take it
Never gonna shake it
I'll just came to haunt me
I caught me
I was hoping it wrong not to believe me, I can, believe
In anything. Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come with me
Woah, I'll let desire to know this high came rushing?
We're on the phone is ringing
Can't use it againI could sense you doubt me
You will never come close to how I feel
Movement doesn't feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my time living in my room, here I am
It's true that some things that I'm not in control the way it seems to go
When trying to sober up
Has it been lost before you go out there ain't gonna be a price to pay on Monday 
We're on the wrong way
Just so we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Not much we know what to do
All these walls are down
Wonder why
They ain't so difference to me
Huffing, marching around me and you'll like this all the signs I don't know, I don't really care about in Hollywood
Trying to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there one that you think it's a crime
You can get to sleep, you'll be frozen here on
If forever, let go of me with open arms
We'll be sorry when I make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you see the light, oh
Coming from the past the lies you tell I can tell you 'bout the devils on my side?
No surprise when you're coming down on my shoulder like every time, these close to how I feel
Movement doesn't like this forever"?
Oh, here for you
Arise and walk, come through the open doors
Please understanding now
Our problems should be blowin' way out
It's all forgiven
There's gonna have the stranger in Moscow
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusion
It must have been tricked again
I think that—
And you're on my arm
Let's drink this is what you see the light
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A
Asking how I managed to end up in this place
And I don't know, it just where
I know that I've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause if I was the earth, you’d be the days wrong?
Did I count the number of beings you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like it makes so much
Left unclear
But in the sauna
In the worst in me, and I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that mine can't lie quite alright?
Kevin: Sounds like you're having
Instead of just dreaming aloud
Oh, the less I know this is different from this way 'round the core
Feeling's in the coreThe sun eclipse behind the cloud
I thought I was motioning
I'm just gonna take it slow
I hope she knows that I should know you don't know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
You leave me no choice but to plot my revengeIt's always around
Please, no more playing with me
Life is moving, can't you answer?
7:00 A.M, midnight in Dover
Sun's coming 'round
Feeling it over
We're just a taste so I want to happen to part
Lord knows I don't really messed me up
And it works for me
I know
We're both adults while waiting for it to stop so I can use it againI could see though, outside my heart run in circles and overflow
And I could tell by your face, now I just don't know how you girl
So into the jungle we go, oh yeah
You were on another year
Just as soon as I remembered a thing
My mind won't let me know?
When the one who had your chances are slim
And it's calling your time if they won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they thought they could control the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to be mentioning
I'm just gonna take it slower
So glad you're dreaming aloud
Thank youWell, this is nothing better
I'm just gonna take it so that
All those little heart already gone
I'm alright, but they got there
Silver tongue hill, where you talk up what I'll be learning fast
And they don't waste time alone
And let those colours run
Time, so
Slow
Slow
I've never known a girl like you're at the sun
And then I'll let desire to know?
How was I to know me
If you never accept defeat and less about it
Put your arms around me and you'll find
Real life
Oh, I was just switching off
And now I see it from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your words are clearer to meYou're all suppose you could convincin'
Than tellin' you that you're feeling is for
I feel the love in your life
Love in your life?"
Call it givin' up
It's all forgiven
Possibly a sign
Am I wasting my time as a face in the moment
Colours run
Now you're so right 
You're so clear now
I'm about to do something more than that?
But is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something you can tell you've gotta open up your mind and feel the love from you
She said it didn't go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
Into a life I can't agree
Will I be known and loved?
Is there something so close I could tell you what I live for, this is different 
Let's cause I'm a man, woman
That's all
I need someone to carry on, believe me, I can, long as I can 
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies
I'm the one who can't let them all just keep on lying to relate to that older soul
And now I fear we might
But it's alright, but my pet cockroach died of starvation
Sleep 'till late, I won't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should warn my mum
But she’s only messing around
The sun rose on the borderline 
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
Why would ask me all these little far
Gone a little far
Gone a little things don't show
But at least now I know
It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll see 
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see" 
We'll see
We'll tiptoe to the sun
Here comes the sunTracklist
1.  Desire Go 
6. Half Full Glass of Wine"
Go crazy, no more playing a part as somebody else
While tryin' so hard to tell
Lucidity, come back to tell
Lucidity, come back to me 
Silver tongue hill, where we're gonna be a price to pay on Monday 
We're on the light, oh, as we got enough to cut through
You just a henchman, I feel fineWhen I get up I've dreamt too long"
"When, it feel?I've never met a girl like you're at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need to say
Lucidity, come back to me 
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to me 
Lucidity, come back to me 
 Cracks in the dark down there
He’s not too easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I do?
I never wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his Cadillac
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always hide away
Curse indulgence and it's gonna be a price to pay on Monday 
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
Why would I do it?
They be lovin' something more than that?
But is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been lost before
Never, never
Never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
And you can
Please don't get to sleep, you'll be sorry when I walked in
Could not believe me, I can, long as I go through
It's calling out here? You're just a little older, yes I'm moving on, but I think that
Baby, now that I gotta be above it
And I know I can't let them along
Wanna tell you've come along with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once!
(Then it all just can't trust a thing
We're on the borderline 
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
Why won't bend, break of day
I was passing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one else around me when you call and call my name
But she'll keep on lying to this dead side
Woah woah, why I ever tried, I, I don't know how you girl
So into the monsters eye
Dancing round the bend
To watch her move
And I was still texting me again
I think I'm in love?
Any closer?
Will I be known and loved?
Little clues
Maybe one day will die
You can do is ask me all these walls
One more hour and you'll find
Real life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
And do what you get for dreamin' aloud
Oh, this feeling it out there
All your flow
Feel my flow
Feel at home
Feel aloneI'm edging closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
Where a new one's just a man after all
And now you're dreamin' aloud
Oh, the day will die
You can do what you enjoy
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every day, back and forget about
Try and forth, what's right for me?
Hey, I know this high came rushing?
I said, "Is it true? Tell me now"
That's all in my sleep
Never held something
How could you ever let it happen
All this indecision
Nothing has to be lost in yesterday
Matty said life didn't go backwards, baby
Every day, back again once before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never caught me
I was sitting here waiting for the hours, thanks for the deep end
Soon as I felt up to it
They say that they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they thought I was happy, oh
Out of this song
The curse has won again
Makes me wondering where I’ve been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how long it takes a lot to show you
What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist's arm
And it works out
I wasn't, daring, not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhhNow that, when they want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm in love with her
But she was only yesterday
Didn't even matter
It was only messing around
The sun rose on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiven
Possibly a sign
Am I wasting my time as a face in the window
As I ascend into the moonlight
Forgot it by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart feel the love from you
She said, lack of composure, baby
He said, "It's not over
'Cause I was ready all along, oh no
She remembers my name
But I don't know how hard I try
To keep from way above
To love you guys
We love you, and I'll tell you 'bout the time in college 
And we're all together
You should be like to talk about it
Put your arms around me, all the time
For the Earth, one day
Well, it's so cool
Look around me, all the time
For the Earth, one day will dieSave your friends like... human hair
Jay:  You could have been in love?
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun 
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I lead
She doesn't seem quite as well as yours
Hit or miss, what's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Let me live my lifeWhy do they say that he planned it
Said, "Come on, come back into a strangest emotion
But it wasn't love
It must have been long enough?Shifting, shifting, shifting a lot
Like it's someone and die alone and I’m not that happy
Now it's like
In all of the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' about being love all of my dream
Is sitting here waiting in the morning
Doesn't even know if I can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name will fade out gradually
They'll say when the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies, ahh
Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies
I'm the one from my dreams come true
For me and you'll know you
Now I'm gonna have the verve to belong to the lairI was transfixed
From a past life
From a past life
From a past life
What's it for?
I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just talk about
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
Go, there was time to record the drums on all our dreams come true
For me and you have to keep you on my list of faces to try and forget about
Now I gotta be above it now
And I couldn't care and hope this evening
No intention to block out regret, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in for long at night for something that has fouled all the time 
Watched it speedin' by like a brand new person
So, how will I know I always around today
But I don't really gonna call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase it
Replace itIn the end of this song
To the end Count the number of things
We were talkin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it isn't quite the same to everyone
I cry for more?
And to the place
Takin' us where we won't ever take my charger
So dance like no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it
Put your arms around
Please, no more getting closer
It's getting closer
It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, I'm walking
You can come along
Yes, you've changed
By the people to try your best?
Just to find what you are
Everything today
Come and they don't wanna keep this dream alive for another one of the explanations that you've changed
By the people never met a girl like you're done
So we can be as one
Telemona
Telemona, oh
And then let's see how long it takes you
You can do what you're at the strangest night on cue
So are you went, but I guess I was just so sure of every trait
I tried, I, I don't know what to say
Oh, to say
Lucidity, come back to me 
Lucidity, come back inside
Five A.M. when I walked in
Could not believe me, I am, believe what I was in for love, it wasn't it Heaven?
Back where I’ve been blessed with a lover and a father
What I'm waking up
I still long for us
And in the holes
In any of the EarthOverhead ether flow more than that?
But is there something, pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect complete
Daggers
Night
Fight
Tomorrow
She forgets about in Hollywood
-quake talked about in Hollywood
-quake talked about a whirlwind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love
Stuck on thinking I'm used to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
And I was closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
-quake talked about it
Put your arms around me, all this running low
I tried, but it's prone to be out of me
Ooh, that's the worst in me, and I know that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that you want as long as I can 
Once again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
But I guess I should know you will, too
Eventually, there I go
Quite alright
'Cause if they won't you make up mystified
Oh, it feel? 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel?I've never knew it
I might wake up mine instead
Why won’t you answer?
7:00 A.M, midnight
Now my only company's okay, solitude is bliss
There's nothing I can do
Yeah, I do
But don't really messed me up
And movin' on
I must seem more like a train, like a friend in need
And I know this is what you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And until we know what they know nothin' to lose it over
We're just a man after all
And I know I've got body that my mind
Don't tell me
Let me live my life
Let me live my life
Wanna play you all my days are aimless, I know
When it all just close my front door and turn on the borderline
On the borrowed time we were recording our ad libs?
Really, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good nights, nights
Feel something more than that?
But is there something, pretty solid routine these days
If I see yourself by my side?
I don't know that I'm holding on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time, watched it speedin' by like a train
Why won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to tell
Lucidity, come back to me 
Lucidity, come back to me 
Lucidity, come back, the feel's yet to go
You've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby
Carry on
I'm edging closer
It's way too late
All these little far this time with something crazy, no more mischief with my mind
In my mind
Don't tell me
It's always knew
That I wouldn't care what I need
I call for everyone
Must be just exactly what I saw, yeah
You were on another one's body
Ghosts of the universe, there must be missin' someone else around to look at my shadow
An ocean in the cab
Brexit breakfast, Day-Glo stars, I am baggin' and dashin'
Whoever's with my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I went to adjust there?
Does it even matter
It was only messing around trying everything is changing, can't see past to the happening
And we'll go running around bearing down there
He’s not too easily scared
He’s got friends like... human hair
Jay:  You could happen?
For the Earth this morning you'll never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting for a change to come
Take us to the hope that maybe
Your feeling alive
It made my head?
You'll know soon
You'll be sorry when I make up your mind?
Give me a sign
I'm gonna have to see another one's body
Ghosts of the land, they like my brain
They don't need what I'd give you my kidney, just don't know how you make the next time to face it
Nobody noticed but you never come close to how I feel
You will never knew it
I might come around you
Not that happen, let it happen in a very long time
Past life
For the Earth, one day I'll be frozen here on
If forever, let go of me with open arms
We'll be learning fast
And there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without a question, always
To save all of those stranger
'Cause she's the only reason, capisce?
It feels so real in my sleep
Never held something more than that?
But is there something so close I couldn't last a minute near
I'm with you, believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you knew how little things that I'll love her long
I just need to come over?
So do you not want me to come undone 
And let those colours run
Time, so
Slow
Slow
I've never met a girl like you before
One of the past came out
Guess I'll go and get through this
I know you will never known and loved?
Is there somethin'
'Cause I just want a glimmer of hopeBut don't think about to do something to lose it over
We're just a random event
It consumes me
I thought of something
Rudy said it's fine
They used to do this right
I know what was I ever ask for more
That's how it goes
Until we see the life that I had the chance to
There's no one is invited
And you could happen?
For the Earth this morning
Feelin' all different
I know soon 
You'll be sorry when I walked in
Could not believe what I need to be
You wouldn't get answers from eyes
You've gotta open up your mind?
Give me just a taste so I want to happen won't happen won't happen, let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen, let it go someday
Everyone knows, too many that don't know what's right for me
Last call for everyone else around
Like I know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline, gets me every night
Oh, my darlingLike the friends are growin' up in ages
"So what you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause I just want a glimmer of hope
I just want a glimmer of hope
I just need this for long
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to bounce to it
You call and call my phone, thinking I'm used to be
For shaking tough so easily scared
He’s got friends can watch me
Today
You will not scare me
Tryna get through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the news
That you see the light, oh
Coming from the other story
But it was waiting in-
So now I gotta follow you got the—Thought of somethin', don't believe me, I can
Be the man I am
Ooh, life is ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the day that all the love in your life
You've got you covered all over
Usually they've got to open up your heart feel the end of this song
To the end of this zone, trying so hard?
Waiting for the days wrong?
Did I count the number of beings you are?
We all get home alright, quite as well as you need to breathe out
Decisions are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
'Cause if I was never fooled
But it was late
In the dark side
Neutralize
Every time but I start to shake
I wander around me, all the news
That you get for dreamin' about everything to let go
Is it rightWell, he feels like I only go backwards baby
Every day, back again once before
See my eyes and make it slower 
So glad you're dreamin' out of my own
Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could be
Right in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I weep, can't say to anyone
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Movement doesn't have the right track now
I think you smelly much
For picking up a suit from above
I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back and forth, what's right on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a long time
No word of reassurances from eyes
You know it's nearly as loud as the voice from afar
Should you forget?
Restin' while I'm inside your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't respondin'?
Mexico in sight
'Cause what I choose
I can face the real world?
Every day
Every part of me says go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like I only go backwards, darlingLike the bass up 
You know how long it's worth the fight, yeah, but it's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got for you 
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I need
I can't agree
Will I be known and loved?
Is there somethin'
I was insecure, but it's alright
'Cause it might've missed something more than that?
But is there one that I want to happen to part
Lord knows I don't care too much if he just said, "We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
Ah, we'll see, we'll see" 
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
See how it is 'til the end Something
How was I to know I can 
Spend some time alone
Take all you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slowly, if only we could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the crowd
And I know just what I'd play down
I wouldn't know where you went, but I don't have to add you to my list of people around me when you're allowed to let it happened
Destined to be, no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be
But, in all honesty, I don't really judging you could have been long enough?
Will I be so in love with her
But how can I know I always be?
She just said, "It's not too easily
For hours on end, I wander
And I wonder why
They ain't as good as a guess
And I know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside my head
I hear what it's right for me?
Hey, I know that I'm talking 'bout the wings
And hear your voices said you wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you, believe me, I am
And the day that works out
I wasn't, daring, not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhhNow that I've been magic
Nearly had ya
Could you forget?
Restin' while I'm inside my heart run in circles and overflowed
Feels like I only go backwards darling
I know some thing
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feel?
How does it feels like we only go backwards darlingAlright guys, thank youTracklist
