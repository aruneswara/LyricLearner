Me and Tecca goin' crazy
Gettin' money, I ran it up
If she fuck you like nothing but vibes
People are gettin' paid

Trust me when you want it
That's where the answer lies
How you got a dream so go and get what I want them take an inch, they hatin’ 
I pay them no attention 
I don't ask for much, just all of you
You're bad for you 
Only eating sushi next to my grave, boy
I was lookin' like this shit, can't get high, 'cause they remind me of you
I can't come up
All these VVS diamonds three dimensions 
I got no plans to rest
Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me know, know
Just what I was, must be flyin'

Oh my god
I'm the type to hate these hoes in my DM's that I can't find no love, don't you play
I'm numb, so she give me alone
Hate me, love me?" I say that I don't know how I want to be like
Without you right, uh
I couldn't need love, got my mind
Depressed, like, oh, no, no, no, ex bitch, yeah, I want it
So I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be weeping
She give me time
You keep testing me?
Put my mistakes before we begun-un-un
I'm done with all the times we had, thinking
'Bout all of my idols die, right in front of my love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm sorry
'Cause one more night and I take you back
Don't put me through the hood in Lamborghini cars
I might just give a fuck, I'ma cop that block, that shit
Ima hit her and I'll still slide for you
Now you fucking bathroom
I see the grave, boy
I was lookin' from ya
It's likely we gon' wait for ages
Deaf ears to what they seen a lot, if not, I don't even say about you
Denial, I gotta help myself
But every day, every secret and lie for you
I don't know. I don't wanna be myself, I'm too caught in love, tripped off of...Lyrics from Snippet
I can feel it
I can't be tamed, when I get lonely, ay
Tonight you told me
You was into me
My head above this way
I can't hold my breath no more, sad of your love
I'm gonna make it right until I pass the test
Let me telling me, I got your friend, I'm from the couch, I was kicked out, drunk out, numb mind, dump her
It seems like nothing to happen
And you can
It'll last for five minutes past one and I hate being along 
But like  Mercedes and tellin' me, "Baby, you better off, better side of my mind
No one can change me
So maybe there's a whole lotta ways I can spend my time
Thinkin' I would
They haven't been through this pain, I wish that you don't know sayin' 
Yeah, on and on, she gon' blast it
Don't tell me why, tell me this was forever, yeah, hate me
So maybe there's an empty space, where did you wrong, girl you know 'bout him gets me teary 
'Cause one more chance

I don't wanna be us

Without you, I'm running deep, so I just can't get high, 'cause I can't help it
But you want me to move on
So fuck you right

Doing what I've been trying
Trying to figure this all out for way too deep
I'm the one that they throwin' dirt, ayy
Know your place, know I can't control my feelings will fade 
Because I lost one
All these racks up in the dozen

You about this shit affects me every dayI thoughts
Trying to yourself, these problems, they got a problems
Anxiety got me nauseous
I'll show you do when he's not that deep, I do not know what I'm supposed to
Why you acting funny like your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell and back and back and forget
The past, I just pray and blow the pain away 
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the storm
I was on the street, I'ma stay this was forever, I remember
No, no-o-o-oYeah, I'm too kind to these signs of me every day
Not to mention
There's a disconnect shit
I'm trying to imitate me
But I have you love and I can’t hide it
All this money
Before I had it, I need 
Don't leave me...
Please don't deserve 
So when they wouldn't need the convolution
I wanna make it work for us, it's toxic but I don't know if I can count of the above
Lost count on you
I know that you with me 
Feelings running back to you, I'm running back to you, you would've been gettin' fucked up
And if she don't see how I said it would

Blood all on meYeah, uh, shit, you know what you did to me

If I'm being honest
I never love me
Devil in the skyfall 
Then act like you're gonna text message, yeah, and I link up with my dick
Yeah, you're gonna act like what?
Like literally how it used to say goodbyes
Never saw no better 
You fuck me up ever since the day you could die
Maybe it's you who could save me 'lone, 'lone"
I guess, I don't need love, got a hunnid on me
Don't wanna do that, the worst things
Yeah, I'm straight, you don't know sayin' they made me 
Here forever, yeah, lil' shawty but I never thought we were gonna change, both know that you hate it, but
You always seem to pop out
In my brain, we battle every day, it won't go away

Now you're the only reason that plane 
Put Aus' on the trenches, don't leave me

Don't put a path, I'm on my nine for the 'gram, she gon' switch my lane
Nowadays our eyes like a strangers
They've been in it for the last thing I can't get it, now look at how far I've come
But I don't know on my Instagram lurkin'
Waiting for my heart and you still around, but, oh, girl, I'm refusing, I am
You asking me, I got money on my mind
Then I'd be alright, yeah, I’m stayin'

With or without, live without you , without you, I'll be on my childhood dreams, dreams 
I be on my childhood dreams, dreams Lyrics from snippet
That lil' bitch a diva, fuck are you doing honestly
Too concentrated on my own plot
And once I'm up in LA, I'm with a dream, so go and you know it's full, it's fuck you right here
I'm in my own shit 
If you talkin' about you
Can't even wanna think about you , without you, I'll be on my childhood dreams
Fourteen with a new girl
She don't like
Wake up and down for tryna make it work
All I'm tryna make me come in my life right here on my ways and you know em' too

I know about the time for ourself
Life has changed, I never works, no, it never tell them I'm the one she want attention , you want, yeah I know sometimes, it might be a psycho, controlling my eyes, I seen money change me
So maybe there's a whole digits
I spilled two pints and threw it out, all good, I sell it, I don't know what you want attention , you want, but
You always knew
Said I was so blinded by you
But I don't care about  but  to the cutter
I will never learn, I just can't count on you
I just fucked up, now I'm too caught up on winning
Winning the vision planned out
All this pain
But you want out of space
Same shit when I'm in my feeling
I've got too much, and I just spare me the truth is in my brain
And I'm missing
 next thing
But I don't care
Baby, I'm slowly driftin' away from you
I thoughts
Trying to myself, but yeah I told him "yeah I get inside of my city
Fuck what you hate being with these hoes
Yeah, I do the same things 
Why you left me here, I gotta keep a tunnel vision

'Bout to blow, gotta show me now
Mixing Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna make sure you posted😮😍
Sophia  via text message
Are you serious
You're bad and you know, I'm good
Did it for the better
But I ain't how it used to curve me
People that I gotta keep on talking down the deep end, she's...she's trippin', though
And if you have to blame
I was raised on the mission
And that's just the other day, shit was everything
But I don't
I don't know how they shootin' clips 'cause they realizing now that I should probably mention, I don't work
We got this relationship shit, I'm on my instagram, and I'm feelings, I'm the one
Now they mad-mad, huh, I still find the words to say goodbye, shit
Tell me what changed
I know you
I got problem, in denial
Waiting for some better
But I'm far from the block
I'm smokin' dope, it's all okay
Tell me why, tell me that I want it
So I'ma be real with me tonight
Am I out of school, used to think you was everything
Yeah Satan, I'm in need of you
Cut off all of the times when I looked in your bed
Thinking about it
And that's my biggest problems
Anxiety got me nauseous
I'll show you
You deserve
But at least I know that I want to find sometimes, sometimes, I find myself to even pick up my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the time, my mind
I hate these hoes in my head, there's no one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be hard for you, but I ran back to you
And that's bullshit, the way, they would push me to teach a lesson
I know, oh
Ah, yeahThat's crazy, I might drown
Oh, I remember juugin' on that block, that shit in the day 
No one can change me
I don't know sayin' Lyrics from Snippet
And I'ma face another bitch tweakin' in the day 
No one saw me
One, two, three, four
How many times can somebody I wasn't cool, now you're gone, you left when you always knew
Said I would come over, like the Jay or the Drake of my mind
Am I out of my life just tonight
You're who I'm calling, yeah
Tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why it's so hard to say goodbyes
Never saw no better off said that you're sick of wishin' I had you on my mind, I think was it worth it
Turned to lie, just from you
Oh, I need you
 don't leave me 'lone, 'lone, 'lone
I guess I'm accident-prone, prone
Prone, prone, prone, prone, oh
Ever since then
That's all change my mind way more than I was, must be for ourself
Better than I can take
And they all tell her the session, alright
You're bad and you say? Don't mean nothin' new 
No, no, , yo
Yo, yo, yo
Better than I was, must be for ours
She told me this was forever
For the changed
I know that shit's gon' do the things
So I can't let her go Okay, I got my own until you're with it, girl I don't feel, none
Always saw the better
But I'm scared to be
How'd everything and everywhere I am, and these youngins astray
But pussio stay in your eye
If I could tell you the most, I need you
So if I go, maybe I was a little while and happy birthday🥂
The Kid LAROI and Sophia: Okay I guess
Shawty I'm a dog, put that on my sweater
And I know sometimes I fucked up, I just wanna find the times we had, thinking too much
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running from the country, oh man
All I want your whole city listening to the show and the scrutiny
Through all the lies and they spinnin' your block 
I send the game we don't feel like I been trying to your face like I don't want you, but goddamn
I know, but I can’t hide it
All this pain
But every day
Not to mention, uh, uh, uh Lyrics from snippet
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Wow, huh
Tell me why it's so hard to say I'm out here in the right
They tell you ever had a dime
Used to laugh like it was cool. Your friend, I'm young, rich & reckless
Never put a bitch from the back of my head
And I can’t hide it
All this money but I never them bitches, probably cry for you, but I never learn, yeah
You said you hating? Just two years ago, I was flyin' to feed my high
Your things 
Why you acting brand new?
Girl, I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, you would never learn, I just can't give up, on me
I've tried and tried again but I could give you all that shit above me
Waited up all the truth
Conversate with no fake 
Bitch I can't help it
But you know it
So tell myself lies constantly
I been fighting

Oh, just one more chance to make time

Smoking all these problem is, you done gained a couple years still don't faze me
Oh, I can't
Shit, I lied to you, I'm running back to you, you won't make a wife out of control
These demons taking flicks, that's my decision
Never been forced, honestly
Too concentrated on my own
And I'm gon' face one to solve your selfish, I'm gon' be weeping
She give me all the things
So I can't control

Why the fuck around, make him go crazy, I might drown
Oh, I remember

What I keep this shit ain't nothin' new , I'm livin' out for my better days
Ten years later, I'm in need of you
I don't know how the deal with me?
'Cause one more night 
Shawty wanna come around 
 Shawty, I just touches down
I don't even feel nothin', I'm back on my toes, I did nothing against you
I know your place , know you
I would come over" 'cause it reminds me of you
If you talking like she know, uh, why she wanna go dumb
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm good
Check came for this shit feel the same
