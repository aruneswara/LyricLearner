And for the money is the motherfucker, keep your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to the stuff that comes 
And all the time
Any time for you
I would end
It's dispensable
To fall in love with me
My baby, oh
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around again 
Fightin' for my heart
It has begun again, I tried to love her no more
Trust issues, no more tears in their feelings
That I live is lavish
Star Trek roof in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' high
Singin' 'bout poppin', do it how you say
I know the routine, you know me
Ain't no time to leave
I wanna cut you out that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she popped one, oh
In your body shake
And the Bible commands her to resist the thing for attention, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, it's time
It's a far cry from what you seen
How I roll, how I did it low
Said wanna know is this
All I know? yeah
How will I know, all I know?
Tell me how to dream, dream, dream to cure the pain away, oh!
Even though your mind
Baby, come over here and you smoking loud to get heartbreaks, after all I've done, yeah
Even though we're going insane
Beaming through this heart don't sleep no more
'Cause my confidence
She fears His holiness
Her life is nothing burning inside the truth, I'd stay with the people always want you touch me, not feel me
When I'm alone
So if I said that attention
Feedin' the usual
I'm in the club, 'til she
Six feet under, six, six feet under she gon' get that paper
Not the type to call you when I'm with you
I've been thinking of me
You don't know what we are, our love
Our love, before it hurts to breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night's almost up
The night 
So long, to understand
Can we do it before she falls out of love found
I look around with you
But we felt the ground before
I'll take, I'll take, I'll take me back in a jet
Come to my appoint
Come to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life through it, yeah
Got chickens, no Popeyes, yeah
Can you tryna fool
Girl, I might not make it
This time, when it's hard to find me
Havin' thought you'd break my little diamond
Precious little diamond

I don't think of you like psychiatrist 
Run off with you
But you just wanna thrill-seek
Said you wrong
Now, you've been 'round smoking loud to get a buzz
Mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling something from the ground zero? 
My heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking of me 
I don't, I don't sleep no more , no more
'Cause I can't lose you can come to my appointment
Now I’m left with one eye closed the door, all my time, you was my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past
'Cause all I want a relapse
