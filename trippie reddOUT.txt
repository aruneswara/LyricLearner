I don't need to chill
Huh, baby take me
Fix me, and that she like, "Ah, ooh," ayy
Ooh, I fucked up energy 
Come on, big dawg who you want, pussy, put the box, beat the playground 
Trappin' trapping, moving work on the distance
In the stretcher, ayy
Pull up with the gleam, I don't feel too well 
Mama hit my phone, I'll make it perfect timing 
And you still gotta get it, man, I'm a six-figure nigga 
If you gang, that's my slime, I'm tryna know it ain't playin' brazy for the gang, gang 
Somebody call Guinness
Scottie Pippen
Yeah, and drive 
I'm on drugs, close that dollar, I go brazy tonight, son
I swear this shit I done bought a Bentley, but I rent it 
Mami don't know that it's like to feel like Rosetta Stone, yeah
Fuck your bitch giving me how you who apply to my games
Migraines, my flames, yeah

Actavis Codeine 
I be gettin' guap , yeah
Feed the fifth
Pourin' up, five hundred racks on me, I'm on 
I'm ridin' around it out of my mind like to talk that ride with that Glocky got a weddin' ring
And it all tonight
