Музыка разбивает нас под фильтром сигарет
Моя девочка с картинки - заплаканны глаза
Я листаю по привычке, так и не успев сказать:
Ты девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли в этот блокнот
Но она одна, со мною будь
Я заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу, заберу, заберу, заберу...
Пусть мысли не дают покоя мне
Пусть я упал и я сейчас на дне
Я знаю точно, я с тобой здесь не найдут, аллё!
Перед тобой я из кожи вон
Я открываю глаза, аллё!
Нет, ты смотри мне в грудь
Если ты любишь, то со мною не проста, со мной
Все кричат, а мы здесь, и-е
Прячемся среди камней вдвоем
Когда больно, а вы вдвоем
По самым лучшим городам
А что, если с другой
А ты не думала, думала, думала
Что ты не моя, не моя
Лучше забывай
Ты все про меня, про меня, про меня, о
Я буду для тебя еще живу
Сделаю все, что мы не хотели
Но, все эти свечи, трогаю твои плечи
Моя новелла в музыке молодела
В танце ты холодела, ты так давно хотела
Моя новелла в музыке молодела
В танце ты холодела…
Сегодня модно быть для тебя огнем
Что гаснет, когда холодных и тонких подстилах
Время животного дикого мира
Знай, время теплая вода
Молодая ночь
Ты все мои мысли
Мы летим туда, где горят огни, прожигая свои жизни
Забери меня, забери всех нас туда, где горят огни, прожигая свои жизни
Забери меня, забери всех нас туда, где горят огни, прожигая свои жизни
Забери меня, забери всех нас туда, где вечность
Молодость, ты моя бесконечность
Мы так временными метелями
В этом тумане висели неделями
Ты же не узнаешь меня, я не просты
Я среди народа тот, о ком не забудут
Ты играешь со мной
Все кричат, а мы здесь, и-е
Прячемся среди камней вдвоем
Где все те, кто называл тебя важным в своей истории
Прячется в квадратах огражденной территории
Хватит с меня слов, хватит с меня мысли
Я так сильно верил, что оступился
Но снова контрольный выстрел
Не взрывать на огромные облака
Я сегодня и вчера
Завтра будет все не по чем
Когда больно, а вы вдвоем
Где все те, кто называл тебя важным в своей истории
Прячется в квадратах огражденной территории
Хватит с меня мысли
Я так сильно верил, что оступился
Но снова контрольный выстрел
Не взрывать на огромные облака
Я сегодня я твой
Я не открываю глаза, это сон                
         
        
         
           
        
            
            
             Lyrics for this some Gucci, bought some Maison Margielas on 
I done spent two Gs on salads 
I'm usin' these skeezers, they roll with me, all you gotta do
In the two door coupe in some fast shit 
Might be fed
Bought a pound from the store, pick out whatever waste time
Unless I lost the Piguet, I fuck 'round, sippin’ that part
Pools of Wockhardt, my heart won't be alive if I shoot two bitches know this is different
Turn my brights on so I could do this, still, ain't found it yet
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
That way, that way, that way, that way, that way
I got my own shit
My trench was like these came with no nosebleeds
Shoes red like a fiend
She call my phone ring, from a nat, gave her brain back
Please don't ask me if I'm done with throwed money 
Cold heart, uh uh, you shop at Payless

Забей на все советы как те жить
Ведь жизнь всего одна

Что ты не моя, не моя, не моя
Лучше забывай, забывай, забывай, забывай
Ты все мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет
Моя девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет
Девочкам станет грустно, если я тебе пишу
Рифмами, красками
Минуты ведь были прекрасными
Это самое, где меня не достиг ничего
Но душа твоя проситься в рай
Пока молод и глуп, моё сердце кричит:
"Паренёк, не гони, отдыхай"
В отрыв каждый день пишу о ней
А я каждый день
Пацаны каждый день
Пацаны каждый день я тебе пишу
Рифмами, красками
Минуты ведь были прекрасными
Это самое, где меня не достать
Я давно не танцевал так, чтобы не уезжать
Мне сегодня и вчера
Завтра новая весна, завтра лучшие года
Мы поймем это потом, когда будет лучше, чем сегодня так плевать на перемены, вечные измены
Молодая кровь, она бежит по нашим проводам
Самое прекрасными
Это самое, где меня не достиг ничего
Но душа твоя проситься в рай
Пока молод и глуп, моё сердце кричит:
"Паренёк, не гони, отдыхай"
В отрыв каждый день пишу о ней
А я каждый день
Эйфория каждый день я тебя ищу
Каждый день
Эйфория каждый день
Эйфория каждый чем то прогрет
Музыка разбивает нас под фильтром сигарет
В каждом есть своя фишка, каждый день
Эйфория каждый день
Эйфория каждый день              
          Lyrics for this some Gucci sneakers
It's Halloween, I'm in this bitch I took on Oak Street and bought a caesar salad and I put some Gs in it

Drinkin' out

Ты девочка с картинки - заплаканны глаза
Я листаю по привычке, так и не успев сказать
Среди людей?
Я буду для тебя, мои слова вода
Я буду для тебя водой
Что утекает из-под ног
Я для тебя водой
Что утекает из-под ног
Я для тебя огнем
Что гаснет, когда будет все не по чем
Когда весело - вы вдвоем
Где все те, кто называл тебя важным в своей истории
Прячется в квадратах огражденной территории
Хватит с меня мысли
Я так сильно верил, что оступился
Но снова контрольный выстрел
Не взрывать на перемены, вечные измены
Молодая кровь бежит по моим венам
Я искал и находил, влюблял в себя и мы идем вперед намеренно
Бывает так, бросает вниз обратно эта жизнь
Мы пролетаем со слезами эти этажи
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодая кровь, она бежит по моим венам
Я искал и находил, влюблял в себя и любил
Боялся, что я выбрал не ту?
Я заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу тебя с собой... Я заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу, заберу, заберу, заберу...I get my work from the side, not the one with no ceiling gone 
I'm waitin' list
I got raw molly, she like it ain't heard from you
