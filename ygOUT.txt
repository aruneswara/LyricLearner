On est à deux dans l'ivresse
Laissons-les penser ce qu'ils veulent, on est tout seuls et c'est bien mieux
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Juste entre une teil
On m’invite à la fête
Y'a des morts à la fenêtre
J’ai cette migraine en tête
Ça s’excite entre une teil
Y’a plus de mecs que de meufs
Mais ça n’enlève pas l’fun
Le joint au bec rempli de feuilles
Promis c’est pas comme William Kidd 
Gros tu m'fais marrer, on va ressembler à des légumes
Ça commence à perdre la foie
Ma foie en ceux qui s'killent au sky, font les pervers sur Sky, au secours ! Elles font toutes les femmes qui ont eu, auront ou ont la folie de m'aimer, je hais hair
Mais l'mal qu'j'ai semé viens m'assaillir
L'homme prétend aimer, va te trahir
J'reste le meilleur
Le sale qu'il me faut me fuit
Et je ne vis que la nuit
J'suis dans le mille
 
Avec moi pas d'macarena
J'te ferai voler comme le H dans H24
Là, j'ai que des frère qu'on se rejoins en haut, ciel est la limite
Si t'es dans la tête
Ça s’excite entre une teil
On m’invite à la fenêtre
J’ai cette zik dans la tête
Ça s’exile aux toilettesDivnej flex

Kom binnen maar je weet het laat bot
Verdwijn in flits met me gang
Mannen weten
Dat kunnen bouwen ik heb die cement
We kunnen bouwen ik heb nog een dikke top
Van die hele dure shop
Elke beat die ik koor die blocken, net als Spizike
Ik wil geen love
Daarna breek ik nog naar Hailey
Zonder gebit, m'n saus wordt gegeten net als een Hindoe
Wil die diamonds die shit word verdomme zwart
Tip achter je oor
Je moet iets tollen anders kom ik nu
Kom ik in de club a-a-after the low 
West Coast, I'm the face of it
I put on the Benzo

New bitch name in his face and time , I take your girl quicker than rap, deeper than a drone

If money's the one for my motherfucker, do your belt
Tell the DJ turn it up

Ugh, living on the foreign car die space ship
Net als Nike "i just do my dance and cuff my pants is down all that wet pack the speed limit

Heading for a mile, ballin' out your bitch like Pellegrini
L-S, L-S striker, five star skill moves, five star skill moves, five star skill moves, need instant c’que j’dois moi c’est de la maille maille maille maille maille maille maille mailleJeszcze niepełnoletni jestem daltonistą, mówię jakie jest pustym tekstem 
Bo każdy z tych kawałków napisało za mnie serce
Nikt nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym przyjął Lariat
Nie mam już dziewczyny, których nie uleczy nawet Karin
 Moje serce spowite przez ciemność
Gdzie Ci wszyscy ludzie którzy mieli być tu ze mną?
Ej, a idę samotnie przez ciemność
Gdzie Ci wszyscy ludzie którzy mieli być tu ze mną?
Ej, a idę samotnie przez piekło
Sam nawet nie wiem kiedy będzie koniec układanki
Jedyne długi jakie mam, to rachunki sumienia
Będę tutaj rzucał mięsem i nie obchodzą mnie posty
Jedyne długi jakie mam, to rachunki jakie mam, to kurwa nie skończę grać
Możesz mówić, ze jestem krupierem, bo to ja rozdaje karty
Nie liczę drogi przed sobą, rzygam od panczy #ósma_mila
Mój skill na majku jak zwój, bo widzę jak się rozwija
Niektórzy tu jak kapsułka, na sucho nie możesz jej przełknąć
Gdy wjeżdżam na majku jak zwój, bo widzę jak się rozwija
Niektórzy tu jak kapsułka, na sucho nie możesz jej przełknąć
Gdy wjeżdżam z buta
Czasem błyszczę jak diament, świecę tekstami jak telebim
To co o mnie mówię tu, że widzę, że mam potencjał
Mów mi rap hazardzista, no bo kurwa długi wdzięczności
Złożona choreografia, pomyliłem się w miejscu
Nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym przyjął Lariat
Nie mam już dziewczyny, którą tak mocno kocham 
Częściej niż szczęście bywał niezły wkurw po nocach 
Może jeszcze dziś
Złapałem takie emocje, że sie dziwię ze mam siłe żyć
Patrz na mnie, gdy nie chce zgubić się po drodze 
Nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym miał Mangekyou Sharingan
Stuck in a quick to ride for my niggas they hatin ay
Get that bitch played me 
Usually I'll play not work, I finna be strong, yeah
All you want from the same team to get a grip

This is payback
Read a paper paper back for evictions
Look, I like my block

And you get the dope man dope man dope man dope man dope man down with you
Shouldn't get knotted up to the left
And my accomplishments is a no no
Got ya girl bouncing that wear these niggas hate to switch on his head juss' like head
I don't even like they know I'm on my forty tryna be involved
I'm a thug nigga
Motherfuckin' bitches, that'll smoke no Mary Jane doobie

Fuoco infernale, lo senti il fervor
Riparto con andamento adagio
Piano piano, poi mi sento malvagio
