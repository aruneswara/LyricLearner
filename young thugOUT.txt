Focado no importantes foram todos, diamantes no terreno
Anos passam, vais crescendo, sem esquecer a raíz
Sítios que vou conhecendo Mem Martins
Um pouco daquilo que os meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
E eu choro por momentos
Ensinou-me a separar os falsos movimentos
São sentimentos perdidos no meu olhar, pelos soldados que deixaram famílias aqui
E hoje ao passar por esta rua me lembrei de ti
