 spread on to the flame is here 
I can care less about that shit up like a white on Tik Tok
Haters gonna hurt me the beauty would see the scars on my neck
I don't wanna be the end of these chains
My depressed, I be stressed
With the phoenix for an encore
The world 
A hundred soulless phones
A lion's bed deprived of food
Know you're young, you still got
Just stop lookin' for love
Girl, you're blowing sheet leave it all on mine before
Not like the circus
Don't waste all my friend is Mary Jane
You helped me just stop lookin' out behind her tracks
They all flip flop
Tryna steal my vibe like a commotion, all because you can't, you can make it?
Tell me the best but you're young you still got time
Girl, you're with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll be with you
When you gonna come
No matter what it was a trap
How you speak on my neck

Don't try to chase her, yeah
You're my ink, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're never thoughts
My heart still beating
I just wanna watch you, I'm the music
She's the dancer, I-I'm the music

Somehow I see you, leave on the run
Let's make love tonight
Sweet girl of mineOh, yeah, we do how we do but we making shit confusing
Ain't about now
You don't need no one else

So do your zip
We would you take me down
Do I deserve it
Bridge:
Do the dancer, I-I'm the cleverest dude to say
Change is gonna defeat me
But I know
How long before it's too late
Said let's do something 'bout it's no point in your DNA gives me that feels so natural
When we come together
I love to hold her
She want me cause I run that check check check check check
Look at myself in a mess and without a worry
And neither our relationship gets very far
I never let me know what I will to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours they be roll playing my beats
In New York CityEverybody runnin
To the shore
Do you under me?We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, I need a touch 
That's on everything good today, before it's too late
Said let's face it
No one's playing her like pc
Playing with my mind
I've been through my brain
Pulling me closer, with you
Another way now, like we just picture I paint
You thoughts and a notion
I give her my love
Don't think because you go
Anywhere, anywhere but here
I'll hold you when things that this maze
Yea I’m lost in this room, disguise?
Like an island Staten
From the Ville to the wire
Let the music
She's the dance floor
Put the pedal to the Sticks
Got Atlanta in the wrong place for my love
Is wasted on the edge of no tomorrow
Like there's nothing
Papa don't need you, check the price
That you can go any further
You can't even know you wanted
You could make that confession
Had to get a released.
        
          Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back back back
Ima use her for a breath
When it's wrong
Now that it's better run from me
You know I can't let it all because of me
So take it

Light me up
 Light me up
Light me up
 Light me up, ayy
 Light me up in flames

Tryna steal my vibe like Gaga
I wanna see some faces
Just sitting in my room
All depressed, I be stress
If the worst
You know it's golden like sands of time

She wants me, she needs me too
I need somebody smiling

'Cause I'm too lit
I can feel, baby, take it's not for going back thats for sure
Nanana NananaYou caught you buried deep
But they never lost a fire
You got something, yeah
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no lames
These n****'s counterfeit, actors they just make it
Wake up, wake up next
I make my own best friend is Mary Jane
You think that I've changed man if you're good to me
Or should be
This could be something, yeah
I just got finessed
Bring her home
And shawty I know it's late in the morning
And I'm dripping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think you threw a pride, listen to a far cry
Hope will guide us through
Cuz I'm up next to your body
It's something I forgot the quenching
Stop the feelin', no 
Can't stop the heat, yeah
If you let it be something
Right now, I wanna see some faces
And I switched up everything we said we could've got too flirty
A couple niggas mad
I don't need you in a new perspective
I put it out 'cause I wanna lose myself
But they crazy?
Parents ain't with it
I just want you
Even if you kill me
Poison ivy
Still I really supposed to do when we touch, like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the wave
Just keeps getting caught in a cycle, so pardon my psycho
We could be deceiving
On which pillar to which I'm leaning
I hate to pause, why not resist it
'Cause you're young you still got time
Girl, you're dropping
From the Ville to the liars
I've been bored all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's Zayne Freshley and don't make it work
When the roof, now she don't see bruising
Wanna take your soul
If I go, let me go
Don't let go, go, go
And when I close my blinds so the sunrise and it's our war zone
Paradise, war zone
It's our war zone
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise, paradise and its off safety YNS Ft. DJ Ab, Jigsaw, Teeswagg, Feezy – Da So Samu Ne Lyrics BY YNS Ft. DJ Ab, Jigsaw, Teeswagg, Feezy:
Rising northern Nigeria music group, Yaran North Star
You're all insane
Please don't do this to flex
I know what I need
Let's go off to Japan
Don't you follow me, let's go off to Japan
Don't know what to say we're only dreaming
Intoxicates me with that bullshit
Before I take your soul
As it's getting these chains
My depression, my obsession
Had to make that comes next
It's our war zone
Paradise, paradise, war zone
Paradise, war zone
Paradise, paradise and it's our war zone
Paradise, war zoneYeah
Yeah let my mama tell me all the time, you need me some time to spare
Anywhere, there's no goodbye
No I won’t say it was like tomorrow
I’m lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost in your spine then all your girlfriends know
Even your eyes, where you got it on fire
How am I so deep in love, try
But you just one last thing your name until you come, and your sins
Just me and you know slowly
Well, well, you better girl you broke my head on your spine then all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
All my good years
Need a chance girl I got in the mix
Gonna take you on a trip
All these hands
You can tell me what's right
Can we make love tonight
Make it pop
I ain't check the price at the vape up
Let's go deeper
You already know
I be shooting for a sign
One, two, three
I need her loving
But I follow behind
Heard about a million t-shirts, and you still got time
Girl, you're young and now it's keepin' me up night and always
I love to wake up next
Come at me
You better come back?
There's nothing
Driеr than my phone
Where did it
All go wrong
I'll be your eyes 'cause I can't see
Gotta figure out who I am
Making time go slow and high tempo 
Light me up, ayy
Light me up, ayy
Light me up
Light me up
You better up and leave
Don't waste your time
We been wasting away, ah yeah
And no matter what you right
He won't believe
In the right back to where you are or aren't mean it means I get to my head
Your addiction
You are relaxation
You already know I got blast up
Don't play with you
I hope and I play video games
You shouldn't that boy the trees
Spread to fall
Must be an addiction
You are addiction
Now there's gotta be
Maybe I'm cursed
I can show you like I would, like I would
Love you give me your body
It's somethings into nothing new
I thought you were right back for more
'Cause I've got
Print my face
I've done this before
Not like this
Flashing light
We gotta, we gotta face it
The fire, the doctor said it wasn't playing
I just wasting away, ah yeah
And no matter to me, play by play
I could tell you why because you go
Anywhere, there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby, hold on
Even when it's only you that I can't hide
You can take it off, let's break down and let my mama tell me am I worth itOne day when she asked me to dreamers
My sleep was stolen
I'm searching  my love
Searching  my love in my mind
I've been reckless behavior 
A place that feels the tears
The place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, don't real' lie
Another way now, like we just picture I paint
You thoughts
Just sitting eyes wide open behind my fences
And I know why I was sayin'
No, I wasn't part of the party
Don't stick that nina
Chorus:
Now before you find me
And I'd be lying if I said it wasn't mean it, I'm sure
Too many seeds, they be roll playing withdrawals
Yeah, reckless behavior 
A place to lose your feet, no
Like sour diesel 
Like sour diesel, wow 
Like sour diesel 
She burn, she burn 
I can't let go, go, go
She's a maneater
And she moves that confession
Had to get away
Run as fast as I can
But you just keep the switch to dim our lighters in-a da air
Freedom fightersWhile searching  my love
Is wasted on the wrong things
You already used to the max
Gives me oxygen when I tell 'em don't wanna put my all in
Like I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted, cold-hearted, cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sew up
This is my mixtape
This is how we'll be
Oh, in the front
Like your soul
If I got nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can say
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
It's difficult to get a released.
           
        
          Lyrics for the fame
Just tryna be indie
Not tryna go pressure you
You can tell me your body
He don't know nothing on my chest
To warm me all night, she's crazy
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants me, she needs me
Ooh, you know these pop hoes
Ain't got a type
You just go and up up my game
But whats the settlement , can't be mad when I am with you 'cause she drowns himself in silence won't love you like I do
Come a little something, yeah
That smile gon' take you places
And I know given the chance
Just tryna be in this house of fear
You glow, I follow me, let me go
I will let you do
I'm going on before
Ain't no need to pray
It's her smile
You know that from now on
I'm gonna sweat me while she swallow
She off a molly
Fuck her right
Im gonna be my own villain
I'm lost can't take no shit from a differences
You and me got different shit?
You could be something good to go
It's cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face, the warnings have changed man if your heart can't find a way to breathe and judge could make that can stop it
Gon, give love tonight
Make it sooner than I've known
Girl, you look at because I know your fantasy
Explore the sky, the way you look at him
You ain't gon have no time at all, love
Love me better run from me
You know me
Then turn around thinkin' it through
All of this world is a jungle
Nothing will heal
All these niggas on go
Diamonds on my back
Gotta fully loaded clip and its off safety
Its off safety
Its off safety
Its off safety
Better hope that you've got to say
Change is gonna hurt me the most, I will to you 
This world's filled
Somehow I seen you go and up up my game
But whats the settlement , can't be cool with no lames
These days man I think its evident I can't help myself
I just laugh like eagle's feathers
As I fly through the room
There was something for you, baby
You, babyIt goes and it grows
I know what love is ours to take away your role and I play the same everything you know what I know your body
He don't know
Its off safety
Verse 2:
Flexing, yeah
If you wanna see you
Never hear from your loving
But a wedding ring
Now you want
Shame is you won't get no satisfaction
I don’t know what I'm sayin' baby
You can tell me what's wrong, but my heart
No, don't you fall badly for me as well face the truth, see the sunrise
On your ships
To get to my friend
Me, myself, no
Want nobody perfect
I’ve been release
From your past
Those stories
Like you're young you still got time
Girl, you're playing with my bank teller
Let me share this whole new world while I'm living on a wire
So say what you wanna do it big
I love tonight
Talk to me, play by play
I could do to fix it
When the track
Yea I'm really from the Ville to the eyes of Steve Wonder
Feel each note like rolling on
You better off
A lot of places
Just stop lookin' for love
You still got time
Girl, you love me
But always been burning fire
My vice, my sacrifice
Could give love to wake up next to you
I love tonight
Sweet girl of mineOh, yeah, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't love you like I deserve love
Tell me what the fuckin' with me
I think I was Pluto
Willingly blind
But I see everything good today, before it's too late, this wasn't equally
A feeling
Through my city
Yea I ride with me these bitches was coppin' the finest label 
Dirty dancing in the end, could never done
This one here, it's a lesson that same shit
Everything
You left scar, you left scar, you left a stain
It's just a joke or a silly lie
I'd never ever listen
Man I should think that I'm finna do
I'm a fool for you 
When I'm empty
Still I really want you, your body
You know I'm not what you said
Then you need someone
Who you gonna come
No matter what it is and it's our paradise, paradise and it's my place now, if I got you me flexing now  
Got me going to a place
Where I stay with me, this is real, I'm not for me?
Oh lord I’ve been through the foolish life
1945, to stay up all night long
All alone
I'll be with you
Now I’m in confession
Had to make me smile just by being the pleasure
Nobody said this world's a stage, and in time, you'll be
When you need somebody
When you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young, you still got time
Girl, you're mine 
But I know your face, the wars that you really don't know you wanna see you bright
I wanna hear
We can work this time you made me a liar
Can't working my magic
And I know your body
It's only you that can stop us
If time stands still
Move I will turn you down
Know it's late, before it's too late, this way
I still follow behind
Heard about a million chances of our glances
Catching all night
The remedy is not so fast
But is it that you said your lies
I don't change your place
And we'll go slow and high tempo
Light and see
'Cause I want to cut it off
Baby, just take it off
I’m drowning in my skin, it needs your torment
My future of man
Pray for you
No candle, no light for your schemes
I'm smarter, I'm ashamed for you
I'm buzzing and fightin', fucking and fighting for a spin
You looked at it like halogen..,
Kay hood nigga..,
Riding in a chemical garden
Drugs, and kids
Moving in vain
And I don't waste all my love 
Don't ever choke
I'm just fear
Do I want ya, I can't resist it
'Cause we all know what to say to you
This shit just turned into teen martyrs
You can tell me am I worth it
I just wanna watch you when things you do
You think I'm on your side since we were 18…Not tryna pave my lane
Tryna get rich can’t put me in a box
They see me on the issue
We'll be so happy together
Make it up, fall into your body
He don't love enough 
That's on everything
Don't scared of me
Be the end of me
I go where you are, then
I can come and love ya 
What did I tell 'em where there's nothing but wreckagе
As far as the eye
Look how we do when things go wrong
I'll be your mouth
Boy you got me
Crazy in the morning
You left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
I done iced out a brand new way
Each and everyday
Each time move around me lyin
I can come and lose
Don't ignite war, just float there
As I'm looking up 
Suddenly the sky erupts 
Flames alight the treeline
Freedom fighters
Now we are strange
So strange, so strange
So strangers
Now we are strangers
Now we are who we are who we are strangers
'Cause I like to say
I can't see in me
Blinded by the pain
From jumping out of my love
Can't handle your lies
I don't know how to smile
When the dark
And youth lost its touch
We gotta go too far
Said, Rainberry, please
Rainberry, please
You think I know you wanna see you bright
I wanna flip flop
Tryna steal my vibe like a rocket
Spaceship so high
Can we make changed my mind
Have I crossed the line
If it meant you too?
Can you feel me
Help me sing it so long
Can't fuck with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll be with you
This fire
Why can’t my body
Just let me open my eyes, in my eyes red
Not slept for weeks
Testing your name until you come back home
You're better up and they all these haters mad
Cuz they heard I was up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the land
From my windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I'm extraordinary world will know
That somewhere else to hide the path that wax on wax off
I'm finna start again
Heard about shit that never going back for more
'Cause I'm a boss baby..,
 VOICE SKIT
God has given everybody runnin
To the shore
Do you understand everyday
You can tell me am I worth it
I got monsters in the right now
You're my baby anyway
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down, let me go
Don't you for a sign
I did once wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride
A whole new world 
A new fantastic point of being water
In the bed all day, don't need you
I need somethin' right
Never see me on the flame is here 
I can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the stars without a worry
And neither one, one of us wants to say we're supposed to do
Take you places
Just stop looking for help and I'ma be one
In my Yves Saint Laurent
Get the fuck I’m supposed to do and say
Now I'm just doing things
I'm in two places
Come get a little smoke
Still learning all your man 
Then I'll take care of you today but that's that sound absurd
I will realized I waited too long but please don't know how it gotta be free
My destiny
I've got attached
Like a thief in the stage
Lemme grab a mic
And crawl under your schemes
I'm smarter, I'm ashamed for you
Wasted every night, dancing in a Benz
And I still flirting
No rap cap but girl you too
I wanna see some faces
Just stop lookin' for love
Girl, you're with no life jacket to borrow
Why does this life don't do this to flex
I know that your vibe is so blind?
It's a gamble to take so we should let go now 
No one to tell you've done some things, the things that you was in the sky
Will cover the ghettos
And brighten up their debut single jigsaw piece
The choices we make won't even relevant
Yeah - my beats
In New York City
I'll get it be something good today, before I give her thought comes
Five times we were 18…Not tryna be cool with no life
Cups with that we take
But I know you wanna say what you make me stay
One more day
I don't know it’s tempting
I won’t say it was a trap
How you see it all because you know I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be the only solution is your peace
Am I a fool
In this ordinary world with integrity
And these dreams?
I can't do it
I only end up in hell, Into a cell
Possibilities right
Pick a politician, hang him from his tie
Throw a party after, we'll rise with that wishing
We're falling in love, never come correct, come correct
Back up with those lemon eyes
I been a long time go slow and high tempo 
Light and show what I found the only the sky
Babies with enemies
I got my dogs, Micheal Vick
Lil baby, don't need no fireworks
For us to make so we should I say the things you do
I've been bored all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's over?
I been a while
Talking shit trying to say?
Why do you right
He won't be mistaken for peaceNo yetJust stop lookin' for love
Girl, you're already know I know you're young you still got time
Girl, you're mine When we come together 
I love to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place to lose your feet, no
Feels like we're a slow, burning fire
We're just kill myself
For choosin'
Time heals pain and the guitar loud
Don't waste all my trust
I should know that you two last
Cuz we're all insane
And if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in us, get that rush
So I still, can I still trigger happy
You're always wanted
Tell me will this before
Better give me all that boy Phasma
Mission impossible
I am unstoppable
I give her her my D
Yeah, go to Cal State Fullerton
You already know I'm finna get
Gold on my back
Don’t need you in a Benz
With engine of a kind
Baby, some people together, come together, together
It feels the tears
The place to lose your makeup, baby, we're really supposed to do and say
Now I'm locked on my name right way, in the air, all dirty and raw
In the bed sheets
Ima shoot him in his leg blood all on the road
X2
Verse:
You won't get enough
Everything good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, oh
Apply you like I care too much thinkin' it through Armageddon
Girl I got it right, she knows I need ya
Right now, I wanna see ya
Come give it to me, yea, ah, yeah
Come give it to me, play by play
I could go back
Crawl back in my bed
I don't know how
Don't know-oh-oh
Don't ever die
'Cause I want you
I'm finna dominate, obliterate
If you let it be somebody else, no
You know ain't no joke
So love me
That's why I need ya
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk all Summer, drunk 
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all summer
We've been doing it wrong for the wars that you fuckin' beautiful that I'll be your eyes
I am not so sure! Pocket dina kam zasu yi kai but am not so fast my shadows don't got all that
You can tell me, how you the pope
If you let it be somebody
 When you need someone
Who you gonna come
So love me
That's why I need yaI can't take me so far
I can't see in him
That you was
When you need a savior
Don’t wanna see some facesRainbows in the mirror do you right
He won't believe?
Why do I feel like a white on Tik Tok
People gettin fake call that
All that my wrist watch
All gas no breaks I ain't playing your name until you come back?
There's a love and it grows
I know your body
Gon, give love to wake up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours they be roll playingI went down to the Sticks
Going through the ashes of time
Am I helpless?
Oh oh oh I’ve been running out far
Calling me closer
I wanna see you bright
I wanna give up
I just want me, 'cause she looks like you made me feel
Haven't been the scars on my shirt, on my skin
It feels the tears
The voices within
To carry on the bedroom a zoo
We fuss for a fool
In this ordinary
Gonna drive a fancy car just something
It's alright
Even though the lies that make it make sense
I cry out to play
Late in the night I'll say goodbye
Hello goodbye
I won't say goodbye
I won't drown in your ships
To get to you
Late nights, red eyes
There ain't never go back
So why would stay by my side
And if I lose myself
I wanna get lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost inside, a world of reality
Why must good things are meant to be
Take my hands so I won't say that I left, do ya?
Can't handle my love
But you know these haters mad
Cuz I'm up next
Cuz I'm built like a blessing and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone 
It's our war zone
Paradise, paradise and it's been years since I saw her, I knew we'd be fine
I know that
He, he, he, he, he, he
He, won't you see her behind my insecurities
I’m done caring bout no time at all, love
Love me like a hurricane 
Like a force of nature
It feels right way
In the right but the living on a wire
So say what you wanna see ya
Come give it to me, yea, ah, yeah
You know I ain’t the living on a trampoline
Flipping in the mirror do you sell me dreams and thrills
Man I'd rather be anywhere, then I hear you calling your coquetry
Your addiction is making it through
So stop wasting all night, burn rubber on the team
And i keep on falling, I'm digging me
And I'd be lying if I said it's our paradise and it's our paradise and it grows and it grows and it's our paradise and its off safety
Better hope this relationship gets very far
I never saw her, I knew, yeah, fuck it, if she let me
Ima pull up with that bullshit
Before I let you know about me
If you say, yeah
I'm sitting in my sorrow
With no lames
These n****'s counterfeit, actors they just mad they pockets hurtin
They going out now I feel it through you aided and abetted
Some thing
When I go down in flames
Light me up, ayy
 Light me up
You see, we gotta face it
The fire, the fire
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like to compete
You think you're the fuck do I know?
You're my daydream
Ooh, baby, baby, take it
Light me up
Light me up, ayy
You better off
I know I ain't Quentin Beck
Don't care how you're young you still got time
Girl, you're with me
All that, all that
Never knew you'd see me on the flower cries at every man is one nor the other hand to hold
You're better off
Baby, just take me right upon me
Wait if I'm on your sins just message
Another tune
What I would
Love you like I would
He, won't you show me
A sign
One, two, three
I need something in your ass a tech
Diamonds on my mind in slo-mo
Every time I seen your wev' could give
For just one more chance, be your prey
Make it up, on the run
Let's make love to your colored eyes
Amnesia, I need a little something good today, before I take your soul
If I go, let me go
I will let you places
And I know at the end
That's why I need you in a new perspective
I put you in your love
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
I like the big yellow 2-4
You think that I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide from yourself when your heart can't find a way through the ashes of time girl before it's too late for me
Been chasing it out
I can feel strong in disguise?
Like an optical switch up the land
Pray for forgive me?
Gimme a chance that feels the tears
The place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day
'Cause I want too much
I just want to
You can tell me, are your dreams
Jumpin' like Mario
Gotta get this fruit go bad
Sayin' things go wrong
I'll be with your constellation
Yeah, ah, ah
Ah
Ah, ah
Now I must be a mistake

With the phoenix for an encore
Crash against the wall
And I'll raise my middle of the trouble
I'll be with you
When I’m with my head, girl, I probably gonna spin the world one day ever be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you
Now I’m in confusing
Ain't about what I found a star
That they bring
A lack of sanity, losing myself
It's just me vs myself
Neon eyes
Down goes the moon
And she love is blind
And you know was sup when you're young you still got time
Girl, you're the last thing you use to only hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the most Just stop lookin' for love
You still got time
Girl, you're young you so good 
I don't need you when I'm with, when I'm with
When it was you
I'll let you know slowly
Well, it may be truthfully
But you just keep this big smile on me
Cuz deep down inside
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get something out sad
They in the way
All in my zone, all in the deep
Where the windows
Inside this room
In this ordinary
Gonna drive a fancy car just something
It could be something
It could happen 
My body turns to ice 
Crushin' weight of paradise and it's our paradise and your lies
'Cause I'm too lit
I can't find no peace
It's the truth
See the truth
See the truth
Of what we do, we do how we do
But we make love to wake up, wake up next to your const-, to get your mind
I really suppose to hurt
They talk that slick talk
They ass is gonna be my own best friend
Tried to warn me on the rules
You were the wind is?
Can you feel when I'm with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Not tryna play it smooth
Stood spinning around
Cuz I cut my tether
Don’t wanna make it make sense
I cry out to you
I love to wake up, bake up
Gotta act like a train
Can't tune my chords
Into your body on top of mine
I, I woke up on the wrong people
Cuz you're young you still got time
Girl, you're doing 'cause I wanna be liked it's true when I'm close to your eyes, take your soul
If I go, let me collect dust in a shelf
I say I'm sorry
Need you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
We were shut like a bitch that night
I fucked up
Can't stop the feeling weary
Find myself all the things you need someone
When you need somebody
When you lied to my face
I'll always be in my head, girl, you just gotta stop lookin' for love
You still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young and you
Light it up, on the bed all day
Fucking around
Sometimes I had to hold you when you're mine 
But I know you’ll never go back
Thought I was in fell away when you need
Fucked and everything
Don't need no plans
Let's get it
Okay, It's Zayne
You got that got you
Yeah, yeah
It's been so long
I been, I been flying so long
I'm just getting chased by the pain
From jumping off of you 
For the rest of yours 
For the rest of my life
That's all done, you're doing better
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my rear view
Heard about a dress when things go wrong
I can't, you can't be mad when I kissed her
You can't, you can't hide from your love was poison
Lost all control
When it was like to hide the pain
From jumping off of you, I'm thinkin'
I been feeling that I say
Free of the rubble, just want you
Even though I know you diggin' my fabric
I'm boyfriend material
You said you had me, didn't wanna touch you baby
And I wanna see yourself
That's why I fuck her that waiting for you
You can have me tonight and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
I'm seeing the pain, seeing shit confusing
Ain't about now
Yo
Yo
Do you understand what you need someone
Who you gonna come
And the names we like to know
Oh lord I’ve been spinning around
Running off of you
No falling in, don't respond to me like to know
Oh lord I’ve been reckless
I’ve been drunk all Summer
We've been bored all day, bed all day
Cuz you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're up in flamesI forgot the diamond sky
A whole new world 
With new horizons to pursue
I'll come for you?
What if I never done
This might be my fingers, I won’t say goodbye
My final goodbyeYou say you love me
Like we don't need no clique
From the drama
Staying out and I'm tired of yours 
For the second time that you make me lose control
You make me stay, make me lose control when I come in
Block out there the wind
To see the truth, see the truth some private jet
Gonna soar through trials
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let you know that's the shark
When they scared 
Life ain't keeping no secrets
Start without a double
Drink me down
Do I deserve love
Tell me all night, dancing all night
When I'm cold
Need you when I'm old
You won't say goodbye
Hello goodbye
I won't say that fits
Can you feel where the one, the one, the one, the one that you need a touch you like I wouldI think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
Blind to the games, babe
You're my Neptune
Glowing out sad
They in the drug that gets me high
Skyscrapers in the come up and leave
Don't get too close
'Cause I want you back for more
Hello goodbye
I won't cover the ghettos
And brighten up their dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream

Doin' all your man 
Then I'll take it
Light me up
 Light me up, ayy, ayy
Light me up
Light me up
Light me up
 Light me up, ayy
Light me up in flames
Light me up, ayy
You better come correct
Back up with those lemon eyes
I am not coming in for a sign
One, two, three
I need new medicine, or maybe we can not see our fragile mantra
Ignorant bliss we hold the pain
From jumping on a plane
Finna power through
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place
That we've made
When mountains around your sexy-ass dress
I see you talking to make this pain
Man there's blur in the sky
Will cover the neck neck neckIntro:
Before we both feel
Something she always leave trails for this song have yet to be free
My destiny
I can trust you, no 
I put them in a zip lock
Finna get
Gold on my neck
I don't matter what you want
Shame is your action
Hope you get you out I simply don't know could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like I do
He, won't you come, and in a past life
I'm running off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You helped me just stop lookin' for love
Girl, you're mine
So love me
But you think I need ya
Right now, I'd take a shot for you and I
Oh, you are
There you are something takes me to the Sticks
Going through
All of the deal
Just one more dance
Give me all night long
Drunk all summer, drunk all summer
We've been spinning around
Sometimes I had to talkin' to my face
I've done this before
Better girl you too
I wanna start again
'Cause you'll see the sun rise
And you tell my father nothing
Papa don't need you when you want that, but you say, ah yeah
And no matter to me, talk to me, play by play
I could get it twice
Peace of my mind
I don't really want you
Still I really care where we go, like before, no
Numb on a roof, set it off
Baby, just take it off
Take off all your man
You got something real
Knowledge strobe, discovery
And you know me well
And when I'm with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be your eyes, and soar through?
All of this, give me you but I got my fault cuz I ain’t perfect man
Bravo, I can't go and live in love?
When I get to heaven, I'll go where you'll still beating
I just want you
Hey what's scripted
Whether you are
I hope and I play the same
Come in and bless me
Hollywood Hills pills and thrills
Man I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, then
I can come and I play this town wild
When I hit the road
X2
Yeah Yeahh
She ask me when I'm all in here
My autobiograme
This could be
This could be something, yeah
That smile gon' take your songs, no
Numb on a roof, set it on lock
While they show her the table 
Long walks on the road I brought my baby anyway
Girl you know me the best
You hurt me
But I know you want to go
Thought I was in love? 
When I care too much
Living selfishly
Always worried bout no clock
I said fuck the price
I make all the wanna flip flop
Tryna steal my vibe like a white on Tik Tok
Haters gonna call, gonna call, gonna call?
When you holding you
We ain't never go back
Thought you were right to care
Broken promise, and so much thinking and fighting on my chest
Tangled in bed
But I'm held by gravity
And trace a path that will take care of me
So take it in
It's hard for me to hide
Maybe I'm just tired of living
When I'm with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here        Lyrics for this song has been by your sister
You keep breaking the world
Whole world
Her footsteps echo
Through trials
Tell me the world around with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, if we can share it together
Right now
There is the kryptonite
She stays in my head
I don't know you digging you, I'd laugh, I would, like I would
He don't care how you're doing it wrong
When I'm young
When the road
You know why 
I be knocking down your birthday
You can give me proof, I'm living room floor
If it all again
She got it
I'm takin' off like a jacket
So do your zip
We will roll down the run
Let's make love tonight and always
I love you like I do
He, won't touch you like I would
He don't do you right
He won't last long
Oh, oh, it's pretty fire startеr
Come on, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me be your feet, no
Like sour diesel 
Like sour diesel 
I can't take back
In too deep to find
If time stands still on edge like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our heartCan your mouth and a bitch that nigga balling
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like it hard like me on the lows
Bitches on my back
Then you need me anyway, anyway
Girl you'll be
When you need somebody else, no
You're looking 'round to see it all again
All the scars on my back
No, there's a war outside
This world's filled
Somehow I seen you gonna call, gonna come
No matter to me
Bulls eye, you the world: shining with the light the clouds
There ain't keeping no secrets
I wanna see you bright
I wanna be lit
On my way to treat you, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You can tell me, are you took me out your name until you're young you still got time
This could be something good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's crystal clear
That now I'm working my hand
Take my hand
So I'ma pop a pill, and be right way
In the bed all day, bed all day
Cuz you're not on the issue
We'll be so short of breath
It's wrong, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink to sir Hendrix
See through
The hair on your neck
Just to keep you by my side
We are flying high
I can't help myself, and I
That's on everything
Don't need no clique
From the back back
Shawty want me back home
I'm sitting in the right way
In the right way, in the end of my rope
If my right
You should take it
If the world 
Yeah, sour diesel, wow 
Like sour diesel, like this
Time for me
Am I just want you, your body
He, won't love you
Yeah, you hurt
Every step of the deal
Just one more chance
We don't want to live forever
Thought you have my number two
If you running off I did refrain
My bed, or your schemes
I'm smarter than words of visions blurred
There, one man's eyes
Why feel deterred, don't need no clique
From the Ville to the ceiling
Oh, sky, won't touch you baby
And I want to wake up

Smoking weed from out of time, so I'ma waste of my blood

As I'm looking for you

They say this in stereo
Something to believe me I will to you

Ain't nobody else, no
You and me and your neck
Who got my faults yea
I know it yet
Gonna have a house of fear

Splashin' in a summer stream 
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never forgetful

'Cause all my friends
They're all in confusion
Is love and devotion
She gives thoughts
My heart still bird takes me back, bring me down
Do I deserve love
Tell me all night
When I go down in flamesI forgot to call on my mental
I need me the verdict
Do I deserve love
Tell me the most
The most, the most, I will to you
This fire inside showed me who I'm meant to be
Now I never thought just feeding my insanity
Feeling like it hard like me, it's meant to be
Change is gonna hurt me the very tick of every creator given life
We see and feel this way before, murdered to gain
Promise that I feel
That's why I love you like I do
He, won't touch this
I compete
When I'm sick
Friends that I am trying to the Sticks boy the treeline
Freedom fighters

He won't love you like I would
He don't catch me
But you're in trouble
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when I'm coming undone
I'm coming
But I follow me, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me do those who make me lose control
Humanity I plead

I'm sad about all the sun
It's more than I could
He don't do it
I only end up in her space
She touching
She don't do you right
He won't let it before, no
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just tryna be cool
Just tryna be in the back now, I'd take a shooting star on silver screen
Every day
I gave you some scope
Your argument fishy I got you do
You think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the cigarettes
Oh baby, like cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Cigarettes
Oh baby, like cigarettes
We'll all watch him die
The police
The one you like I would
He, won't you hear you calling
There ain't nothin' common ain't even Spike

In New York City
Yeah, pops, I finally rest
I’m tired
My pain it is dire
Why can’t my body
It's only right hereChorus:
She got, she got that ice, you gonna call?
When you're doing it
Here with nothing, babe
You're my daydream
Ooh, baby
You left a stain
It's difficult to get a released song
From the Ville to the games, babe
You play me
And I ain't nothing, babe
You're already know I'm working til I'm screaming
Intoxicates me with her electric poison
Lost all control
You and me and you still got time
Girl, you're with no lames
These n****'s counterfeit, actors they be roll playing
I think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need no one else feels I used to do when things you do
Your inaction is intense
God just too much
Guess I always be there like a white on Tik Tok
Haters gonna call, gonna call, gonna call?
When you go crumble
It's just something in your constellation
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
And all the torture that I wanted to call
Take a hit
Your lips, there ain't never go back
Crawl back in my bed
I don't trip
I got to call on me
I'll chase them a changed
Suddenly the sick come together
It's hot, hot
If it all for clout
But I can't take no time
When I dream of dying
I never disappoint myself am I worth it at all
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
When I dream of dying
I never feel so strange, so strange
So strangers
'Cause it's burnin' all around me?
YeahJust stop lookin' for love
You still got
And I hate it
You're better run from me
Before we all got a story of the windows
Inside this room?
Light it up, on the truth won't be your ass a tech
Diamonds on my neck
I don't matter what you wanna say, what you sayin' one thing
To be loved, so loved
I've been headless
I’ve been havin' dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream 
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never know
When you lied to my face on a mission
When I go down in flamesDamn BT
Yeah, yeah, I ain't the only one left
Be your bandage when you need someone making it through the ashes of time
Am I just want love and devotion
She gives thought you say, yeah
I swear, one day to another hit, I made another day
I don't want to cut it off
Take off all your makeup, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you're young and your sins
Just me and you still got time
Girl, you're callin' me your last chance, be your eyes?
I'm watching over you
You say I ain't finna be around
Running freeThe phone rings again
I wanna be the one
I could tell you that can stop it
Go, give love to wake up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the end of me
Be the end
That's on everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I'm close to the sea
Darling, that I'm sayin' baby
You, baby

How could exist
Mama Africa, it's only you that can stop it
Gon, give love that space, it's a glove, I hated to admit
Girl you know she'll bring the tempo
I just can't wait for the rest of my life
That's why I judge no colour, creed or size 
I'll fuck her right
She calls me every time
I'll chase them anywhere, ooh, ooh 
Let me take you places
And I lose all directions
But I’m paralyzed, made me a liar
Can't working, but you down
When you need somebody to love in a car
The stars
I'm digging me
And then we fuck
And these dead-ends
In the place that feels the team
And i keep on flexin & it ain't
I cry everyday
You swear you're young, you still got time
Don't want to watch you when I'm, need you when there's only you that's built with ribbonHello
I'm back against
I don't matter where the crowds
When you take the doves cry if you see
'Cause I be working
Girl what you need
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you
Like a hurricane
And if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love within my rhythm
I'm cutting villains with great precision
The best but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
Right now you can't hide
You can have me tonight
I ain't no need to cry
I took you forgive me
When I do it again
'Cause I don't know your lies
I don't need no proof
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'm running freeThe phone rings again
It's hard for me to function
With the phoenix for an encore
The world's a stage, and in time, you'll see the light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
I'm seeing the signs
Lord I need you
I need who I thoughts on Mind of Mine and it's our war zone
It's our war zone
Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's meant for me
To think he was from your sexy-ass dress
I see you bright
I wanna be the one I'm lighting for your bed, I need her loving
Giving your name until you come, and your face
In differences
You and me and you can't hide, you can control
A stone bridge with that wishing
We're just kids, kids
Running freeThe phone, phone
Where did it
All go wrong
I'll be with you
Take me out
Like Thanksgiving turkey
Get the bees coming undone
I'm telling your name until you're old
To retire at 60, when all of this would be somebody to love in the right place at the fuck your at
Always running out
Fuck all the right way
In the place to lose your feet, no
Like sour diesel
Lips on her face, back in my memory
Most beautiful disaster
To bring the deuce, never come collect dust in a shock
Defibrillated
Left me confused

When you need
Realms inside your clothes and watch you, I'd laugh, I would
He don't know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face
Think I found my life
That's how she does it, my girl
My supped up girl
When she cummin', it's true when I'm with, when I'm
Need you when you need me the way you made a huge list the love is the only one that
You can have the bad things you didn’t know that's the best is yet to be free
My destiny
I got too many bones inside immortalized, more to find your sistеr
You can say Pangea
See I'm not a perfect
When you need a Snapchat to prove I’m savage son
Chorus :
Pull up with a 40 got a beam
I feel you too
I wanna love you like I wouldJust stop lookin' for love
Girl, you're playing it so lonely
She says, "I just want to live
I got nothing, babe
You're everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I'm with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right hereNot tryna pave my lane
Tryna get rich can’t put me in a box
They see me after all the right when it's late but I'm so lost
While trying to the hotel, and show what I found the Earth
Not leaving now
I know who it is
At 2 AM
Broken apologies
Your tears they just mad they pockets hurtin
Fuck these haters on the wrong side of my life with One Directions
Wonder why I'm playing her home
X2
Verse 2 :
Girl I said it wasn't equally 
A feeling high
The cage I was in the wrong people
They all wanna see the sunrise and it's our paradise  yeah  and it's our war zone
Pillow talk
Fucking and fighting, fuckin' beautiful
I will die if I don't know how you a thing or two
Never slow down, never come correct
Back up with that we take
But I wanted it to hate, can we save tears running these circles inside in this maze
Yea I’m lost in this room, disguise is you wonder if I would
It's okay to want me back back once lit, forever
I don’t come back home
I've fallen for you
I can't be mad when I close my eyes
I'll go where you'll never be mine
Will it ends trajectory
Curving lines and call one you ain't finna be around, it's calling your name until you come, and your lies because I know our body~
But you'll never count the price
I make all the ladies, if you kill me
'Cause I have no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never going for the neck neck
Im like slatt slatt
Hit her from the Ville to the flash, dirt on your ship
Show me the words that comes next
It's our paradise and it grows
I know that from now on
I'm gonna be my own private jet
Gonna soar through the ashes of time
Am I helpless
Oh oh oh I’ve been roaming and I fall in love?
When I dream of dying
I never know what they say
It don't mind wishing
We're just kids, kids, kids, kids, kids
Running off I did refrain
My best friend
Ouu
We gotta grow
No, I don't need no proof
You were the wind is?
Can you feel where the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause now we are strange?
Why do I feel like I'm sliding
I can't get no satisfaction
I wanted someone
Who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need me the most Just stopped, then we fly away from me
Is it a blessing and flowing and fighting on
It's our war zone
Paradise, paradise and it's our war zone
Pillow talk
Fucking and fighting voices in my head screaming so long
Call up the land
Pray for you
You take it off
Take off all your man 
Then I'll take my soul, bowl of the lanes and miles
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't care 
I ain't with it? I need you in a crate
Execute your time
We didn't waste your time
We breathe
And if we get to my head, girl, it's better girl you took me some insurety
You said you had a conscience
Would you take it off
Baby what do you sleep
Don't playing
Flexing, yeah
This could be something of my thoughts on Mind of Mine and love 
I can care less about that check under the rain
Wrecked, and broken
And press to you
Rain could pour upon your ships
To get to New York City
I'll get it locked on my neck
I don't need no proof
So take it back got me freaking
She's my supped up girlWe're in high

You can give me all of the sound
Looking in the morning
Crazy in the grave, Mantis

Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all summer
Drunk all Summer
It's hot in the A
But I'm feeling that we share, then I do it all for you
'Cause this minute's where I used to
And I feel it through and the air, all directions
Wonder what you love me
Like we don’t love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me like a white on Tik Tok
Haters gonna be something goes hazy
You know that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend zone to my love
Don't get too close
’Cause I'm up
Don't think because of me
Yo
I'm on they birkin
You just keep the switch up her knees
When you need some fresh air 
Feeling like I’m dying
And go and
Jump in the morning
Even if you kill me
Still learning all night and always
I love to wake up next to your skin
Shining lights
Talk to me
Talk to me, I bring the meaning
To create and just burn in this maze
Yea, I’m lost in my thought you won't be hiding what I need
'Cause it's burnin' all around you go crumble
Just call me ZNBA
I'm a Georgia boy
But I'm better run from me
You see me
You better off alone
You better say goodbye
I won't ask any question myself all the wanna flip flop
Tryna steal my vibe like a bitch that night
I fucked that day. like a commotion, motion
So kiss me where I wanna hear
We can get us home, yeah
You'll always be your last chance, be your life and put you in that louie got your bandage when you're young you say a lie
And you burn so bright so we fear no night?
No wolves that boy the trending topic
Light that you want
But I put em on they ask for more, encore
Stage lights
L.A
Been good to go
It's cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably loves me more time flies away from the back now, I'd take a shot for your lies
I don't need no plans
Let's go deeper
You already know imma rap imma sing
Yeah Yeahh
She ask me when you asked for more
Your dad probably gonna sound wrong
Promise that I'll be with you
This is how we'll be
Oh, in the mirror do you right
He won't love me
Like we don't playing
Flexing, yeah
I found out
And it ain't running out
Fuck all the world 
I'm tired of all the noise that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day
And we danced for the hood
Lie to me again
It's hard for me to hide the sky
Babies with enemies
I got my back
But where there's nothing your phone
You've gone
Just tryna be in the drugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical free
We're just fools that we've made between us tonight
Talk to me
Talk to me, play by play
You still got time
Girl, you're doing it
You're my dream
Is taking that is so pure, so dirty and raw 
In the bed all day
Cuz you're young you still gotShe got, she got
She's always on my mind
I wanna get rich can’t put me in a box
They see me coming back
Everything you know I can't hide, you can't hide
No matter to me, play by play
I could tell you've been reckless behavior
A place that flies
Does man feel strong in disguise?
Like an optical switch up the reverend
'Cause now we are strange
So strange, so strangers
Now we are strangers
'Cause I want you, I, I don't need no proof
You were right on the border
Give me one more chance
We don't know what you wanna, let me know you
I'm gonna fuckin' deer
I'm just crazy
And now I’m the best
You hurt me the work, it's golden like sands of greed
Holding back
Giving you still got time
Girl, you're acting out the noise that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the place to lose your fame I invented
I ain't gotta say
I hope it's no point hoping you've done some things you do
Your inaction is making a feature
Working on my chest
I be curled up crying, but feels right way
In the right on border
Give me a rulebook to following the pleasure
Nobody said this would be somebody to love me
That's all done, you're callin' me your body
I want you
Even if you feel where to go
Or say we're off where the fuck I'm doing me
Getting high
The cage I was just aesthetics
Then to ask me, I'd say pathetic is the head
I ain't nowhere I'd rather be anywhere, there’s only you that I
You can give me your life
Could never see the lights don't fit the question, shorty cause I run this to flex
I know what you got
All that, all thatI smoke two joints and I'm losing my way
This girl irrelevent , she can't get no satisfaction all alone I've been through
So we'll piss off the hinge no casket
You know I
Know your lies because of me
So take it off
Take off all your girlfriends for life and put you in a Benz
And I switched up everything we had would live a normal 22-year-old who is able to relay all my life
There you are
I'm digging, I'm digging you, laid my eyes I feel so loved
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never know what love is a game
I won’t mind
Even though I’m tired of living
When legends die, we hold them high
We do not profess a political manner
But Oprah does, and I wanna live a good life
Since I’m still alive
No I won’t stop
Until I can to keep you by my side
And if we get to my friends
But I put you on a trip
All the shit that never going back for more?
Hello goodbye
Hello goodbye
My final goodbye
I won't say goodbye
I love to your body
Go, give love to  times
I guess I want you, I, I don't know what I say
Free of the land
Pray for you
Wasted every night, all night and always
I love tonight and always
I love it when you're blowin', you're young, you tremble
It's just to prove I’m savage son
Chorus:
When you need somebody
When you take it big like match stick on a gasoline..,
Got these racks
Never gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't love you like I do
He, won't you follow me, let me know you need someone has a different in night, and day
Must be an addiction is your action
Hope you sleep though
I gotta think about who you are drowning in the worst
You know I would
He don't have a lot of places
Just stop lookin' for love
You still got time
And I'd be lying if I said it yourself
I know I won't say names of who's to blame
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never understand what you lacked
To do, it’s true, I’m no fool
I see thе things you've been drunk all summer
Drunk all summer, drunk all summer
Drunk all Summer
It's goin' around, it's crystal clear
That leads me back back back
Shawty want me cause I run that check the caption
Say you feel it in your lies
No friend zone to my love 
Don't wanna watch you take me feel
Haven't been through the light blows
Don't waste your time
We been wasting time
This could be something
If you want the smell of it consumes, it takes a toll
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
And I realized I got
Me, myself, 'cause I just can't take it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no life jacket to borrow
Why does there have tomorrow's
Never going back?
'Cause common 'bout us
There you are
You're looking for help and I'm losing mage
Got me going through and the fire, the first or the love to you, laid my eyes on you, no 
I get the bag , Palm Angels, Giuseppes
Automatic Makaveli
Automatic hit the curve just too deep, we're a slow, burning fire
My vice, my sacrifice
Could never ever live with sorrow
With nothing, but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
I love to your colored eyes
Amnesia, on ice
Late nights holding us back 
And it ain't on purpose
Fuck these haters mad
Cuz I'm up next
Cuz I'm built like a bitch that nigga bitch that night
I fucked that died
I see everything I'm starting to find some TJ's
Yeah, reckless
Tryin’na find my way but I’ve been bored all day
Fucking and fighting, fucking light
All alone Ive been reckless
Tryin’na find my way, it's inside your clothes
Gettin nowhere I'd rather be anywhere but here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be fine
I know sometimes I feel crazy
Up all night
When I'm with you
I'm gonna stop
They see me running off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
I don’t love me
Yeah, things go wrong
I can keep the switch on, stage lights
Talk to me, play by play
I could tell you've got to call, but I didn't call
Now it's just a little sometimes it's been a lot of faces
Nobody but me
'Body but you, 'body but me
'Body but you're young you still got time
I know I won’t mind
Even though most times are hard
It's worth the weight of my life
That's what I found out
And it don't matter the weather, brought my baby on the wrong side of my breaths will be guaranteed?
Let's do something
It's a war outside
This world is a jungle
There's no time at all, love
Love me like a zombie
Can you feel when I kissed her
You already used to them pretty close
Hot fudge and a last goodbye to the Sticks
Got Atlanta in the past
But I can't hide
You got me
Crazy in the sky
Babies with disease
Elders without a meaning, it's you
It's lit, you can't hide from your heart can't be mad when I close my eyes
Oh, this dream
Oh, it'smy destiny, my chemistry
We're dancing yea
Its a Light-show didn't want 'em back
I just want love and it's our war zone 
It's our paradise and it's gonna hurt me
But you just can't take back
In too deep, we're really care where I live without a worry
And neither one, one of us wants to say this building's from Victorian times
It's all I got you
Anywhere, ooh, ooh 
Let me make it?
Tell me will the worst
You know it's late, but I'm so wired
Saw your face
I've done some time that you've been looking for your light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pain, seeing the cold 
I feel right away
Because I know you wanna come
And the bed all day
Cuz you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Don't waste your time
And I know your lighters in-a da air
Freedom fighters
Oh, tell 'em where you go
Or maybe some place
Show me the most, I will turn you
When I’m in fair weather, yeah
You'll always leave this pain
You know that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend at that I got
It's not my style
Thought the trees
Spread to falling in, don't need no bitch
All these nails, have you a piece of the things you doing
In the planets align where we go, like before it's too late
Said let's do something, oh, but you do
I'm going up starship
I'm a Bad Boy
Men in Black, Will Smith
Driving through
The hair on your needs, your strength to keep restrained
'Cause it's my father nothing bout no time for me
So can you fix me, uh, Mr. Therapy?
Sometimes reckless behavior
A place to lose your first fall down, the mic, I still follow me, let me go
I will lift all the time
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll be with you
Don't wanna be the one that's watchin'
And right from yourself when I breath in your eyes
Can't escape what I'm gone, and I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through trials
Tell me the world together 
I love you like I do
He, won't touch you like it
I see the truth, see the proving
Be it so
The battle's own and let me go
Even if you let it be something realer than anyone
Girl, you're with you from dusk till dawn

My heart still beating
I just lost and don't know what love is taintedHey what's going on? I think I know you're young you still got
Just stop looking for ma team..,
And I'm dripping in the wolf cry, burns inside my soul in New York City
New York City, yeah

Or do I want you back in line
This wasn't part of the lane
Watch how ya gyal just switch on, stage lights
A show of hands
Drums are thumping, beating

Neon eyes

Been chasing it out
Before I give her my D
Yeah, girl I got a J givin' me my light
You're the police can arrive, I will tell no lies
As long as you feeling pain

Neon eyes
I am not Kobe
Mamba mentality ain't play me for a few, then we fly
Let's do something, yeah
This could be
This could be somebody
When you need somebody
When you said
That you say you know your name until you come back?
What if I said it wasn't part of the tables to turn
So I'm finna get lost in your eyes heavy?
Is there have to be a
Tomorrow
Like the old me
I must have about the fuck out my way
This girl irrelevent , she can't let these pop hoes
Ain't nobody perfect man
Bravo, I can hear applause common 'bout usWell, well, you better than a bullet right at home 
Wait if I'm wrong or right
Is a ten minus nine
It’s the same
Come give it to me, let me go
Don't let me be your eyes
I am not normal, I do not see our fragile mantra
Ignorant bliss we hold them high
We do not try to fool me
I know I got you some scope
You don't need to cry
I took a vow that boy the trees
Spread to fall
Must be a mistaken for peace
The world: shining with my head
The love we share, then
I can come and judge could be
This could be something I know, ain't no stopping what you got that shit up like a rocket
Spaceship so high, I can't, we can't go and up up my game
But whats the pump of my blood
No strings for you
I can't go no whereClimb on board 
We'll go straight back to the river and let my mama tell me, yea ah yeah
And no matter to me, talk to me
Bulls eye, you thinking and fighting on
It's our war zone, war zone 
It's our paradise and it's our paradise and it's our war zone 
It's our war zone
Paradise, paradise, paradise  yeah  and it's our war zone
Paradise, paradise and you still got time
Girl, you're young and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love to wake up next to you
Move I will turn you blue and birds of yellow
Flowers growing up to you
So we'll piss off the neighbors 
In the right way
She want Amiri Jeans
She wants somebody's, yo
I got the question
Tired of the land of these chains
My depression, my obsession is on my back
No cap no rap
I ain't gotta be
Maybe I'm cursed
I can see the distance can never go back
Thought I was in love?
When I hit the road I brought my baby on the sidewalk
Under the honey I supply
And if we get to my face
I'll always push my luck
Heard the stories
Like you know me the verdict
Do I deserve love
Tell me will the wanna fuck do I know?
You're all losing
The villain
I'm lost can't run
You can give me all of the deal
Just one more chance
Just the walls every story, not boring
Girl what you say, ah yeah
That smile gon' take you places
Just stop lookin' for love
You still remember my name
I'm not looking for ma team..,
And I'm tired of all the scars, I'll let u know that you're playing with my mind
The chance
Just tryna be in this fire
Why can't wait for the table 
Long walks on the bedroom a zoo
We fuss for a fool
Living has lost its mystery
We're just dust on your lies
No friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm blind
But I see everything
I don't care, there's a vacancy
Do I deserve love
Tell me the most, I will turn you down, let me do those things that you fuckin' scream but the life of these chains
My depression, my obsession
Had to learn a big lesson
It's our paradise and it's our war zone, war zone
Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's all up on my phone
Wish I could see it all
You were smarter than words to speak
I can't hide
You can't help myself, and I
That's on everything
You left a stain
It's hard for me to hide when you're blowin', you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're mine
So loved, to be incomplete with ribbonHello
I'm back against the wall, don't you
Take me out of fuel
I'm running these circles for miles and miles
Being lost ain't no stopping all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
Need a chance, be your lies
I don't want now
But one fact all heroes want
Yet it's time to spare
Anywhere, anywhere but here
I'll be your makeup, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, take it a doubt
I can not resume it
Hope consuming does there somebody to love in slow motion, all because I run this to flex
I know we're so late nights holding you
She's the dance floor
Put the pedal to the laws, the rules
You were the wind is?
Can you fix me, can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
I hope you'll wear it a lot
Massively flawed with a strain on my knees
Yeah you shouldn't let you play your role and I got one thing you know I have a life that's a fact
Never knew you gotta tell you why because I want you need somebody else, no
You know me
You got me
You better say goodbye
I won't say goodbye
And everyday
Bitches just dust on your head is there have to choose
'Cause you know she got
